27366&EventDate & \cellcolor{red}there seems to be a problem, but we don't know how to solve it & 
dwc:eventDate does contain a value. \textbar dwc:eventDate is not consistent with atomic parts (1985-06-06 <> [0][null][][][]) \textbar dwc:verbatimEventDate parses to the same value as dwc:eventDate.
