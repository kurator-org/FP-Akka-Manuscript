\section{Appendix A MCZData} \label{appendix1}
\normalsize
Attached is a spreadsheet
\\\textit{iot} = https://github.com/kurator-org/FP-Akka-Manuscript/blob/master/data\_in\_and\_data\_out\_v2.xls 


The spreadsheet \textit{iot} has three tables, which together illuminate how the data 
in Table \ref{ExampleQCAssertions} is derived from two underlying records in the MCZ specimen database bearing catalog numbers 27366 and 6270740, respectively. That said, Table \ref{ExampleQCAssertions} may be taken on faith without impediment to reading the paper. Otherwise, it is best to have some familiarity with 
\\http://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/FP-Akka\_User\_Documentation, especially 
\\http://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/FP-Akka\_User\_Documentation\#Workflow\_2.

The first table in \textit{iot} is a CSV dump of the aforementioned records, with artificial repetition for convenience in consideration of discussion in the next two tables in \textit{iot}.

The second table in \textit{iot} corresponds to the output of the post processor as described in
\\http://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/FP-Akka\_User\_Documentation\#Post\_processing

The third table in \textit{iot} is crafted from parts of the second  \textit{iot} table, 
to provide the data for Table 
\ref{ExampleQCAssertions} in the main body of the paper.

The following odd part of the Provenance in the bottom row of Table \ref{ExampleQCAssertions}  is produced by code in FP-Akka and indicates a failure to curate the data. In this case FP-Akka was unable to fill in a value for event date from the atomic fields (startDayOfYear, endDayOfYear, year, month, day) because these values are empty or null in the input data:\\
\hspace{1in}``dwc:eventDate is not consistent with atomic parts (1985-06-06 <> [0][null][][][])''
