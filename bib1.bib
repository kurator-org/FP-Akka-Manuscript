	abstract = {Natural history collections are the authoritative source of knowledge about the identity, evolutionary relationships, and attributes of species with which we share this planet. As such, collections of research specimens play a central and critical role in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The potential contribution of specimen data to systematic, genomic, and ecological analyses is enormous, and will be orders of magnitude greater when information is made easily accessible via distributed networks compared with stand-alone database systems in use up to the present. The Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS) is a distributed database network that permits participating institutions to provide web-based global access to their collections data for research, education and informed decision-making. The simplicity of the network’s design ensures that any institution wishing to join MaNIS may do so at relatively little cost and with relatively little technical expertise. Although development of MaNIS and its underlying architecture relied on a number of key programming tasks and innovations, much of what the project can offer at this pivotal juncture is insight into its approach and a template by which other disciplines can engage in a similar process with equal success.},

abstract ={Sensor networks are revolutionizing environmental monitoring by producing massive quantities of data that are being made publically available in near real time. These data streams pose a challenge for ecologists because traditional approaches to quality assurance and quality control are no longer practical when confronted with the size of these data sets and the demands of real-time processing. Automated methods for rapidly identifying and (ideally) correcting problematic data are essential. However, advances in sensor hardware have outpaced those in software, creating a need for tools to implement automated quality assurance and quality control procedures, produce graphical and statistical summaries for review, and track the provenance of the data. Use of automated tools would enhance data integrity and reliability and would reduce delays in releasing data products. Development of community-wide standards for quality assurance and quality control would instill confidence in sensor data and would improve interoperability across environmental sensor networks.},

  Abstract                 = {A key clinical problem in low-vision assessment is finding simple measures that are predictive of real-world performance. Our purpose was to determine whether a set of clinical variables could predict how well low-vision subjects read with their magnifiers. The variables were Snellen acuity, presence/absence of central scotomas, clear/cloudy ocular media, age, magnifier type, and score on a standardized test of reading speed (Minnesota Low-vision Reading Test). Forty low-vision subjects identified the magnifier they most "preferred" to use, based on the frequency and length of time used, ease of use, or any other factor considered important by each subject. All subjects were highly experienced with their magnifier (3 months to 21 yr of use). We classified the magnifiers into five categories: (1) standard correction only; (2) hand-held magnifier; (3) spectacle-mounted magnifier; (4) closed-circuit TV; and (5) stand magnifier. Subjects used their preferred magnifiers to read aloud printed paragraphs of about 150 words from which their reading speeds were calculated. By far the best predictor of the magnifier-aided reading speed was the score on the standardized reading test which accounted for 79.7\% of the variance. 43.7\% of the variance was accounted for by age, and 42.3\% by magnifier type. Snellen acuity, central visual field status, and ocular media status were not significantly correlated with magnifier-aided reading speed. We conclude that a standardized clinical reading test can give a valid prediction of the reading speed a low-vision patient is likely to achieve with a magnifier.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing consensus that clinical evaluation of the real-world consequences of eye disease requires new performance-based tests. This is because Snellen acuity and other common clinical tests are often poor predictors of everyday function. Ahn and Legge [(1995) Vision Research, 35, 1931-1938] validated a computerized test of reading speed by showing that it provides an accurate prediction of low-vision reading performance with magnifiers. Here, we describe development of a printed-card version of the test suitable for clinical use. This printed-card test retains key design features of the validated computerized test, including the same set of sentences and display format. Data from 23 low-vision subjects showed that a very simple testing procedure using printed cards and a stop watch could be used effectively to estimate reading speed. Reading speed based on a single card was quite accurate (SD equal to about 18\% of the mean) and showed no practice effects from one card to the next. Reading speeds obtained with printed cards correlated highly (r = 0.887) with those from computerized testing. We conclude that a simple test, using printed cards, can be used to obtain useful estimates of low-vision reading speed.},

A psychophysical procedure was used for measuring reading speed that has proven reliable and sensitive to visual factors in previous research. Data were collected for character sizes ranging from .15 degrees to 12 degrees. Research revealed that old subjects who were free of eye disease read as fast as the young subjects for character sizes ranging from .3 degrees to 1.0 degrees. This is the range in which reading speed is maximum for young subjects. Research also revealed that old subjects showed a deficit when reading text composed of very small or very large characters. Their speeds dropped to about 70\% of the young adult speeds. These deficits may be due to age-related losses in visual contrast sensitivity.},

Contrast sensitivity functions of the patients with multifocal lenses did not differ significantly for optical distances differing by 2.5 diopters, indicating substantial depth of focus. Normal and monofocal contrast sensitivity functions were nearly identical, and both were about a factor of two higher than multifocal contrast sensitivity functions. Patients with multifocal lenses showed deficits in reading speed only for low-contrast text (less than 30\%) and small letters (0.2 degree and 1.0 degree).},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of biodiversity in both living and fossil groups depend on raw counts of currently recognized named species, but many of these names eventually will prove to be synonyms or otherwise invalid. This difficult bias can be resolved with a simple "flux ratio" equation that compares historical rates of invalidation and revalidation. Flux ratio analysis of a taxonomic data set of unrivalled completeness for 4,861 North American fossil mammal species shows that 24-31\% of currently accepted names eventually will prove invalid, so diversity estimates are inflated by 32-44\%. The estimate is conservative compared with one obtained by using an older, more basic method. Although the degree of inflation varies through both historical and evolutionary time, it has a minor impact on previously published background origination and extinction rates. Several lines of evidence suggest that the same bias probably affects more poorly studied, hyperdiverse living groups such as fungi and insects. If so, then current estimates of total global diversity could be revised downwards to as low as 3.5-10.5 million species.},

  Abstract                 = {In two experiments, we explored the degree to which sentence context effects operate at a lexical or conceptual level by examining the processing of mixed-language sentences by fluent Spanish-English bilinguals. In Experiment 1, subjects' eye movements were monitored while they read English sentences in which sentence constraint, word frequency, and language of target word were manipulated. A frequency x constraint interaction was found when target words appeared in Spanish, but not in English. First fixation durations were longer for high-frequency Spanish words when these were embedded in high-constraint sentences than in low-constraint sentences. This result suggests that the conceptual restrictions produced by the sentence context were met, but that the lexical restrictions were not. The same result did not occur for low-frequency Spanish words, presumably because the slower access of low-frequency words provided more processing time for the resolution of this conflict. Similar results were found in Experiment 2 using rapid serial visual presentation when subjects named the target words aloud. It appears that sentence context effects are influenced by both semantic/conceptual and lexical information.},

  Abstract                 = {This contribution explores the problem of recognizing and measuring the universe of specimen-level data existing in Natural History Collections around the world, in absence of a complete, world-wide census or register. Estimates of size seem necessary to plan for resource allocation for digitization or data capture, and may help represent how many vouchered primary biodiversity data (in terms of collections, specimens or curatorial units) might remain to be mobilized. Three general approaches are proposed for further development, and initial estimates are given. Probabilistic models involve crossing data from a set of biodiversity datasets, finding commonalities and estimating the likelihood of totally obscure data from the fraction of known data missing from specific datasets in the set. Distribution models aim to find the underlying distribution of collections compositions, figuring out the occult sector of the distributions. Finally, case studies seek to compare digitized data from collections known to the world to the amount of data known to exist in the collection but not generally available or not digitized. Preliminary estimates range from 1.2 to 2.1 gigaunits, of which a mere 3\% at most is currently web-accessible through GBIFs mobilization efforts. However, further data and analyses, along with other approaches relying more heavily on surveys, might change the picture and possibly help narrow the estimate. In particular, unknown collections not having emerged through literature are the major source of uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Two experiments are reported that examine the influence of semantic contextual constraints on an individual's ability to use parafoveal visual information. Subjects were presented either a word (reptile) or a row of Xs in foveal vision along with a parafoveal nonword (snckks) centered 2.3 degrees or 5 degrees to the left or right of fixation. The subjects were asked to pronounce the parafoveal stimulus aloud. During their eye movement to that stimulus, the nonword was replaced by a word that was either (a) semantically related to the foveal item and visually related to the parafoveal preview nonword (snakes), (b) semantically unrelated to the foveal item and visually related to the preview (sneaks), (c) semantically related to the foveal item and visually unrelated to the preview (lizard), or (d) semantically unrelated to the foveal item and visually unrelated to the preview (limits). In Experiment 1, subjects were only given 250 msec to use the semantic context, whereas in Experiment 2, subjects were given 1,250 msec. The results of both experiments yielded highly significant effects of contextual constraints and parafoveal visual information. However, the first experiment yielded additive effects of the two variables, whereas the second experiment yielded interactive effects. The results are discussed in light of recent arguments regarding the importance of contextual constraints for the use of parafoveal visual information.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Numerous database management systems have been developed for processing various taxonomic data bases on biological classification or phylogenetic information. In this paper, we present an integrated system to deal with interacting classifications and phylogenies concerning particular taxonomic groups. RESULTS: An information-theoretic view (taxon view) has been applied to capture taxonomic concepts as taxonomic data entities. A data model which is suitable for supporting semantically interacting dynamic views of hierarchic classifications and a query method for interacting classifications have been developed. The concept of taxonomic view and the data model can also be expanded to carry phylogenetic information in phylogenetic trees. We have designed a prototype taxonomic database system called HICLAS (HIerarchical CLAssification System) based on the concept of taxon view, and the data models and query methods have been designed and implemented. This system can be effectively used in the taxonomic revisionary process, especially when databases are being constructed by specialists in particular groups, and the system can be used to compare classifications and phylogenetic trees.

  Abstract                 = {Most people with low vision require magnification to read. A magnifier's field of view often contains only a few letters at a time. Page navigation is the process by which the reader moves the magnifier from word to word, and from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line. Page navigation takes time and reduces reading speed. The major questions addressed in this paper are: (1) What role does page navigation play in limiting reading speed? and (2) Are the window width requirements for reading (number of characters in the field for a criterion performance level) increased by the need for page navigation? We measured the reading speeds of three normal-vision and seven low-vision subjects in two ways: with drifting-text requiring no page navigation, and with a closed-circuit TV (CCTV) magnifier which required page navigation. We built special hardware to record the location of the CCTV's magnified field in the text. These recordings were used to separate forward-reading time (left-to-right movement through the text) from retrace time (navigational movement). For normal-vision subjects, forward-reading and retrace times were about equal. For low-vision subjects, retrace times were shorter than forward-reading times, indicating that the forward-reading performance was limited by visual, not navigational, demands. The retrace time did have an impact, however, ranging from 17 to 50\% of the overall time. The window requirements for reading with page navigation (CCTV) were larger than those for reading without page navigation (drifting-text). The difference was more than a factor of three for normal-vision subjects and close to a factor of two for low-vision subjects (10 characters for CCTV vs 5.2 characters for drifting-text for 85\% of maximum reading speed.},

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.}

Preview display changes were during the 1st saccade entering the target word region, whereas postview display changes were during the 1st saccade leaving that region. Previews and postviews were either identical, related, or unrelated to the target word. "Wrong" information in the target-word region affected reading even when that information was seen only after readers were fixating to the right of that region: When readers skipped the target word, such information caused readers to regress to the target word more; when readers initially fixated the target word, such information increased "2nd-pass" processing time on the target region. The data suggest that readers often still attend to a word after it is skipped and that when readers fixate a word, they occasionally attend to the word after they have begun to fixate the next word.},

Subjects read sentences in which a word or phrase was focused by a syntactic manipulation (Experiment 1) or by a preceding context (Experiment 2) while their eye movements were monitored. Readers had longer reading times while reading a region of the sentence that was focused than when the same region was not focused. The results suggest that readers encode focused information more carefully, either upon first encountering it or during a second-pass reading of it. We conclude that the enhanced memory representations for focused information found in previous studies may be due in part to differences in reading patterns for focused information.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental prerequisite of the Semantic Web is the ex- istence of large amounts of meaningfully interlinked RDF data on the Web. The W3C SWEO community project Linking Open Data has made various open datasets available on the Web as RDF, and developed auto- mated mechanisms to interlink them with RDF statements. Collectively, the datasets currently consist of over one billion triples. We believe that large scale interlinking will demonstrate the value of the Semantic Web compared to more centralized approaches such as Google Base5 . This paper outlines the work to date and describes the accompanying demon- stration.},

  Abstract                 = {A somewhat counterintuitive finding has emerged from experiments that restrict the "window" of visual information available on a fixation during reading: fixation duration increases even though there is less information to process on a fixation. The two most likely explanations for this phenomenon are: (1) that the reader extracts abnormal information outside the window and this slows down processing; (2) that a restricted window does not allow a preview of a word before it is fixated, and hence identification of the word is slower when the word subsequently is fixated. In the present experiments, these two alternatives were tested. Conditions in which the size of the window alternated between fixations were compared with conditions in which the size of the window remained constant from fixation to fixation. This manipulation allowed us to separate effects due to restriction of the size of the window on the current fixation from preview benefits (which would be due to restriction of the size of the window on the prior fixation). Two experiments demonstrated clear beneficial effects on fixation duration due to receiving a preview of a word on the fixation prior to when it was fixated. In contrast, restriction of the size of the window had only marginal effects on the fixation on which that restriction occurred. In addition, a subsidiary analysis suggested that the benefit of previewing a word was influenced by its length; for short words, a preview primarily allowed the reader to skip the word more frequently, whereas for longer words, a preview primarily shortened the fixation time on the word when it was later fixated.},

After its beginnings as a technology advocated by computer scientists to overcome problems of heterogeneity, ontology has been taken up by biologists themselves as a means to consistently annotate features from genotype to phenotype. In medical informatics, artifacts called ontologies have been used for a longer period of time to produce controlled lexicons for coding schemes. In this article, we review the current position in ontologies and how they have become institutionalized within biomedicine. As the field has matured, the much older philosophical aspects of ontology have come into play. With this and the institutionalization of ontology has come greater formality. We review this trend and what benefits it might bring to ontologies and their use within biomedicine.},

Researchers are effectively prevented from determining, preserving, or providing the lineage of the computational data products they use and create, however, because of the lack of a definitive model for lineage retrieval and a poor fit between current data management tools and scientific software. Based on a comprehensive survey of lineage research and previous prototypes, we present a metamodel to help identify and assess the basic components of systems that provide lineage retrieval for scientific data products.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Reading rate has been the main performance measure in studies that have compared reading with large print and optical magnifiers; eye movement characteristics have not been considered. We compared both eye movement characteristics and reading rates for subjects with macular disease reading without and with a range of low-vision devices. METHODS: Silent reading rate and eye movement characteristics for text passages at critical print size of 21 subjects aged 14 to 88 years with macular disease were measured with and without their preferred low-vision device. Saccadic frequency was determined from a sequencing task comprising five letters each separated by 5 degrees. Eye movements were recorded using an infrared limbal reflection system. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in reading rate, fixation durations, saccade numbers per word, or percent retrace time when using a low-vision device compared with reading without a low-vision device. The percentage of regressions was, however, lower with the low-vision device. Saccadic frequency in the sequencing task was predictive of reading performance with and without a low-vision device. CONCLUSIONS: When reading at critical print size, in terms of reading rate or saccades per word, there was no advantage to using large print over an optical low-vision device.},

The standard deviation for the group was about 3 times that of the individuals in the group. We calculated the criterion for reduction of visual acuity for the group, as group mean plus 1.96 group standard deviations; use of this criterion would consistently fail to detect patients with clinically significant reductions in visual acuity. We recommend that visual acuity be measured to threshold for every patient. Measuring visual acuity between three and five times provides an estimate of the patient's variability and allows a criterion for reduction of visual acuity to be established for the individual patient. Use of this criterion will enhance the sensitivity of visual acuity measurement as a diagnostic tool.},

This result, in conjunction with our earlier work on temporal discrimination, indicates that the processes which are responsible for temporal summation of the eye (presumably located at the receptors) are more resistant to the degenerative processes of ARM than are those responsible for temporal discrimination. This may be because the simple threshold procedure used here does not sufficiently stress the temporal response system to show a deficit.},

Provided that at least some tests are free from error for some of the populations, the tests performed serve to eliminate certain populations from contention. This leads to constructing the key by choosing the most useful next test. Here, usefulness is measured by a function of the vector of numbers of contending populations falling into various response categories. General desirable properties of such functions are developed and new functions recommended both in the error free situation and when error is present.},

  Abstract                 = {Reading characteristics were studied in age-related maculopathy (ARM) by monitoring eye movement patterns as subjects read word charts and text charts that contain a wide range of print sizes. Eye movements were monitored with an infrared scleral reflection device and subjects were tested over a wide range of chart luminances. In normal subjects, as print size approaches threshold, reading speed slows mainly because of a decrease in fixation rate, whereas regressive saccades remain infrequent. There is little change in the ratio of number of letters read per forward saccade. With decreased luminance, there is a decreased reading acuity but the relation between reading speed and the size of print relative to the threshold size remains relatively constant. Subjects with ARM show similar fixation rates to normals, but they average fewer letters per forward saccade and make more frequent regressions. ARM subjects are more likely to have reading performance strongly affected by luminance. The number of letters per forward saccade can show a strong dependence on luminance, whereas fixation rates remain relatively unchanged. It is proposed that reduced reading performance in ARM is predominantly the result of a reduced perceptual span, with poor oculomotor control playing a secondary role. Optimal print size may be best predicted from letter chart acuity (r = 0.70) or word reading acuity (r = 0.69). Word reading acuity is the best predictor of peak reading speed (r = -0.74), whereas peak reading speed is poorly correlated with contrast sensitivity (r = 0.26) and scotoma area (r = -0.42).},

However, there is little quantitative information about how they change with local, regional and global threats. In this paper, the first standardized pantropical forest terrestrial mammal community study, we examine several aspects of terrestrial mammal species and community diversity (species richness, species diversity, evenness, dominance, functional diversity and community structure) at seven sites around the globe using a single standardized camera trapping methodology approach. The sites{\textemdash}located in Uganda, Tanzania, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Suriname, Brazil and Costa Rica{\textemdash}are surrounded by different landscape configurations, from continuous forests to highly fragmented forests. We obtained more than 51 000 images and detected 105 species of mammals with a total sampling effort of 12 687 camera trap days. We find that mammal communities from highly fragmented sites have lower species richness, species diversity, functional diversity and higher dominance when compared with sites in partially fragmented and continuous forest. We emphasize the importance of standardized camera trapping approaches for obtaining baselines for monitoring forest mammal communities so as to adequately understand the effect of global, regional and local threats and appropriately inform conservation actions.},

Given a ground set V and a collection of subsets Si of V, a feasible solution is a partition of V such that each subset of the partition is included in one of the Si. The problem involves maximizing the mean subset size of the partition, where the mean is the generalized mean of parameter p, taken over the elements. For p=-1, the problem is equivalent to the classical minimum set cover problem. For p=0, it is equivalent to the minimum entropy set cover problem, introduced by Halperin and Karp. For p=1, the problem includes the maximum-edge clique partition problem as a special case. We prove that the greedy algorithm simultaneously approximates the problem within a factor of (p+1) 1/p for any p in R +, and that this is the best possible unless P=NP. These results both generalize and simplify previous results for special cases. We also consider the corresponding graph coloring problem, and prove several tractability and inapproximability results. Finally, we consider a further generalization of the set cover problem in which we aim at minimizing the sum of some concave function of the part sizes. As an application, we derive an approximation ratio for a Rent-or-Buy set cover problem.},

The study used an event-related paradigm with high-speed echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to trace the time course of the brain activation in the temporal and parietal regions as participants comprehended single sentences describing a spatial configuration. Within the first set of images, on average 1 s from when the participant begins to read a sentence, there was significant activation in a key cortical area involved in language comprehension (the left posterior temporal gyrus) and visuospatial processing (the left and right parietal regions). In all three areas, the amount of activation during sentence comprehension was higher for negative sentences than for their affirmative counterparts, which are linguistically less complex. The effect of negation indicates that the activation in these areas is modulated by the difficulty of the linguistic processing. These results suggest a relatively rapid coactivation in both linguistic and spatial cortical regions to support the integration of information from multiple processing streams.},

Discovered knowledge is expressed in the form of high-level, easy-to-interpret classification rules. In order to discover classification rules, we propose a hybrid decision tree/genetic algorithm method. The central idea of this hybrid method involves the concept of small disjuncts in data mining, as follows. In essence, a set of classification rules can be regarded as a logical disjunction of rules, so that each rule can be regarded as a disjunct. A small disjunct is a rule covering a small number of examples. Due to their nature, small disjuncts are error prone. However, although each small disjunct covers just a few examples, the set of all small disjuncts can cover a large number of examples, so that it is important to develop new approaches to cope with the problem of small disjuncts. In our hybrid approach, we have developed two genetic algorithms (GA) specifically designed for discovering rules covering examples belonging to small disjuncts, whereas a conventional decision tree algorithm is used to produce rules covering examples belonging to large disjuncts. We present results evaluating the performance of the hybrid method in 22 real-world data sets.},

In Experiment 1, the effects of a completion meter, punctuation pauses, and variable word duration were studied. Although the Normal Page and Sentence-by-Sentence formats were still superior, post-experiment ratings indicated that punctuation pauses improved user preference, and preference for RSVP in general increased with practice. In Experiment 2, a modified RSVP condition included a completion meter, punctuation pauses, interruption pauses, and pauses at clause boundaries.

Most importantly, the challenging task of routing messages based on their content remains a complex and time-consuming operation, and often provides results that are just barely better than a simple broadcast. In this paper, we present a novel approach to publish/subscribe that was designed to specifically address these issues. The producers and consumers are organized in a peer-to-peer network that self-adapts upon peer arrival, departure, or failure. Our publish/subscribe system features an extremely simple and efficient routing process and excellent scalability to large consumer populations, both in terms of routing and peer management overhead.}

 abstract = {The author asserts that biologists have been quite unrealistic in their predictions of what the computer can do for them in the realm of computerized data banking. With a backdrop of several years of "hands-on" experience in the Flora North America Program, he analyzes the veritable mythology about data banking that has been fostered unwittingly by the proponents of computer-based information (data) retrieval systems and challenges biologists and other scientists who are prospective designers of such systems to demythologize computers and data banks. The data bank is not a larger-than-life creature of science and technology having vast, McLuhanesque powers to digest information and spew back answers. The myths about the computer lead to unrealistic assumptions and expectations, becoming in time grand delusions and dangerous snares. Four myths are discussed: I. The Myth of the Automatic System, II. The Myth of the User-Oriented System, III. The Myth of Compatibility, and IV. The Myth of the Liberated Scientist. Under the first myth, six specific fallacies about data banking are discussed, concerning personnel requirements, the flexibility of computer media, and the computer's capacity to facilitate the organization, editing, and publication of data. The computer, it is asserted repeatedly, has a greater potential to enslave than to liberate the scientist. It is concluded that computerized systems are not alternatives for conventional systems of storing and retrieving information (data), but merely extensions or enhancements of such systems. Computers will not substitute for people, nor will automation replace the hand of the expert. The author, even while exposing what he terms data-banking myths, tries to make plain his own continuing dedication to the computer revolution in systematics as it pertains to information retrieval, but he stresses that this revolution can go forward only on the basis of realities, not on myths.},

abstract = "Computers are ubiquitous in the life sciences and are associated with many of the practical and conceptual changes that characterize biology's twentieth-century transformation. Yet comparatively little has been written about how scientists use computers. Despite this relative lack of scholarly attention, the claim that computers revolutionized the life sciences by making the impossible possible is widespread, and relatively unchallenged. How did the introduction of computers into research programs shape scientific practice? The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ) at the University of California, Berkeley provides a tractable way into this under-examined question because it is possible to follow the computerization of data in the context of long-term research programs.

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic relationships of the five families of the order Commelinales remain an area of deep uncertainty in higher-level monocot systematics, despite intensive morphological and anatomical study. To test the monophyly of the Commelinales and the subclass Commelinidae, evaluate their relationships, and analyze evolutionary trends in their morphology, ecology, and biogeography, we conducted parsimony analyses on 95 rbcL sequences representing 17 taxa of Commelinales, 16 taxa of other Commelinidae, and 63 taxa from Arecidae, Liliidae, and Zingiberidae. Commelinales is polyphyletic and Commelinidae paraphyletic, with Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae sister to Poaceae and its relatives, Rapateaceae sister to Bromeliaceae and Mayacaceae, and Commelinaceae sister to Philydrales and allies. Thurnia is sister to Prionium at the base of Cyperaceae-Juncaceae; only 1 of Cronquist's multifamily commelinoid orders is diagnosed as monophyletic. We propose a revised Commelinidae, incorporating 4 revised superorders (Bromelianae, Commelinanae, Dasypogonanae, Arecanae) and 10 orders ((Poales, Eriocaulales, Cyperales, Typhales, Bromeliales), (Commelinales, Philydrales, Zingiberales), (Dasypogonales), (Arecales)). Morphological and anatomical characters used to define the original Commelinales and Commelinidae appear to be plesiomorphic or to reflect convergence or recurrent mutation; several characters supporting our revised classification are anatomical traits that seem relatively insulated from environmental selection pressures. The Commelinidae distal to the Arecales arose in South America, with amphiatlantic Bromeliaceae-Mayacaceae-Rapateaceae originating in the Guayana Shield. Ecological diversification involved the repeated invasion of shady, infertile, or arid microsites. The numbers of species in families of the revised Commelinidae are related partly to the extent of adaptive radiation in those families, but seem more strongly related to nonadaptive features promoting speciation, such as restricted seed dispersal (especially in forest interior groups with fleshy fruits), polyploidy, aneuploidy, and apomixis. Species diversity is unrelated to the rate/amount of rbcLsequence evolution. (C) 1999 Academic Press},

  Abstract                 = {The eResearch Group within the School of Information Technology \& Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland (UQ) [1] is collaborating with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in the development of the annotation services to be provided as part of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). Annotation services enable users to attach additional information or interpretive data to existing resources, datasets, or individual data records. Over the past few years, collaborative tagging and annotation systems that involve communities of users creating and sharing their own metadata have exploded on the Internet. Sites such as Flickr, Del.icio.us, Connotea and LibraryThing are considered exemplary of the Web 2.0 phenomena because they use the Internet to harness collective intelligence. Such systems provide a community-driven, “organic” approach to classifying information and resources on the Web, so that they can be discovered, browsed, and re-used. The UQ eResearch group has been developing annotation services for text, images, audio, and video files used by cultural and scientific communities. Research has been directed to determining how annotation/tagging services can be used to harness the collective community intelligence to add value to the datasets. This work will be extended to encompass the unique requirements of the biodiversity community underpinning the ALA. Our objective is to enhance interoperability with other disciplines and systems using Annotea, a W3C specification for an extensible core data model for annotations (Figure 1). This model provides an XML/RDF schema to which annotations must comply. A key activity is to determine the specific extensions required to the underlying Annotea schema in order to support biodiversity data and the needs of the biodiversity community – for example, the annotation type classification as keywords/tags, descriptive, question, comment, correction, ranking, etc. One of the first objectives is to determine and agree the functional requirements with respect to the annotation services for the ALA project. The aim of this phase will be to address the key use cases specified by the community. Initial feedback and discussions have identified the following broad user needs: • The Annotation structure is to be defined by an established, extensible metadata schema tailored for ALA specific use cases • The schema is to be available from a repository in standard formats (RDF \& XML Schema) • Annotations are to be centrally stored using a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) with multiple indexes, flexible administration, and access control • Annotations are to be retrieved through a REST-full interface supporting result sets, specific annotations, or harvesting via OAI-PMH with set support • Annotations may entered singly or in bulk through a schema validating REST-full interface A critical aspect of this project will be to develop simple, easy-to-use Web-based user interfaces to support the broad range of use cases including the easy attachment of annotations to images, maps, and particular data records or database rows or columns. Users will be able to search and browse existing annotations and may wish to be notified automatically via RSS subscriptions of any new annotations. Some communities may want to restrict access to their annotations to authenticated users only. A further requirement will be the ability to harvest annotations stored on remote community annotation servers and aggregate them with the ALA metadata store to enhance discovery. Figure 2 provides a high level view of a proposed system architecture that uses OAI-PMH to periodically harvest community annotations. References: [1] http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/∼eresearch},

  Abstract                 = {At present, the structured P2P algorithms have been proposed frequently. Consequently, the P2P application developers need to learn different API semantics. It causes additional efforts of switching to different P2P topologies for P2P applications. Moreover, it is difficult for the developers to evaluate the performance of an application based on a particular underneath P2P APIs. In this research, a novel P2P framework is proposed to assist in developing P2P applications by using various structured P2P protocols and P2P pub/sub algorithms. We construct the structured P2P functional blocks, including network communication components, P2P topology maintenance and routing, network bootstrapping, as well as pluggable pub/sub services in our system. By Comparing to other P2P libraries and platforms, our framework achieves a great success on providing a flexible and extensible development platform.},

  Abstract                 = {Reading in peripheral vision is slow and requires large print, posing substantial difficulty for patients with central scotomata. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of print size on reading speed at different eccentricities in normal peripheral vision. We hypothesized that reading speeds should remain invariant with eccentricity, as long as the print is appropriately scaled in size–the scaling hypothesis. The scaling hypothesis predicts that log-log plots of reading speed versus print size exhibit the same shape at all eccentricities, but shift along the print-size axis. Six normal observers read aloud single sentences (approximately 11 words in length) presented on a computer monitor, one word at a time, using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We measured reading speeds (based on RSVP exposure durations yielding 80\% correct) for eight print sizes at each of six retinal eccentricities, from 0 (foveal) to 20 deg in the inferior visual field. Consistent with the scaling hypothesis, plots of reading speed versus print size had the same shape at different eccentricities: reading speed increased with print size, up to a critical print size and was then constant at a maximum reading speed for larger print sizes. Also consistent with the scaling hypothesis, the plots shifted horizontally such that average values of the critical print size increased from 0.16 deg (fovea) to 2.22 deg (20 deg peripheral). Inconsistent with the scaling hypothesis, the plots also exhibited vertical shifts so that average values of the maximum reading speed decreased from 807 w.p.m. (fovea) to 135 w.p.m. (20 deg peripheral). Because the maximum reading speed is not invariant with eccentricity even when the print size was scaled, we reject the scaling hypothesis and conclude that print size is not the only factor limiting maximum reading speed in normal peripheral vision.},

Subsequent studies (Holmes, V. M., \& O'Regan, J. K. (1987). Decomposing french words. In J. K. O'Regan, \& A.

Coltheart, Attention and performance XII: the psychology of reading, Erlbaum, Hillsdale N.J., 363-383) have shown that lexical structure can affect the location of the optimal viewing position. In this paper we show that the optimal viewing position is near to the position which minimizes word ambiguity arising from incomplete recognition of the letters in the word.

A practical methodology is thus demonstrated to enable botanical or zoological taxonomists to use ANNs as advisory tools for identification purposes. A comparison is made between the ability of the neural network and that of traditional methods for plant identification by means of a case study in the flowering plant genus Lithops N.E. Brown (Aizoaceae). In particular, a comparison is made with taxonomic keys generated by means of the DELTA system. The ANN is found to perform better than the DELTA key generator, for conditions where the available data is limited, and species relatively difficult to distinguish.},

CharaParser annotates semistructured morphological descriptions in such a detailed manner that all stated morphological characters of an organ are marked up in Extensible Markup Language format. Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a general purpose syntactic parser as its key annotation tools, CharaParser requires minimal additional knowledge engineering work and seems to perform well across different description collections and/or taxon groups. The system has been formally evaluated on over 1,000 sentences randomly selected from Volume 19 of Flora of North American and Part H of Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. CharaParser reaches and exceeds 90\% in sentence-wise recall and precision, exceeding other similar systems reported in the literature. It also significantly outperforms a heuristic rule-based system we developed earlier. Early evidence that enriching the lexicon of a syntactic parser with domain terms alone may be sufficient to adapt the parser for the biodiversity domain is also observed and may have significant implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Specimen identification keys are still the most commonly created tools used by systematic biologists to access biodiversity information. Creating identification keys requires analyzing and synthesizing large amounts of information from specimens and their descriptions and is a very labor-intensive and time-consuming activity. Automating the generation of identification keys from text descriptions becomes a highly attractive text mining application in the biodiversity domain. Fine-grained semantic annotation of morphological descriptions of organisms is a necessary first step in generating keys from text. Machine-readable ontologies are needed in this process because most biological characters are only implied (i.e., not stated) in descriptions. The immediate question to ask is How well do existing ontologies support semantic annotation and automated key generation? With the intention to either select an existing ontology or develop a unified ontology based on existing ones, this paper evaluates the coverage, semantic consistency, and inter-ontology agreement of a biodiversity character ontology and three plant glossaries that may be turned into ontologies. The coverage and semantic consistency of the ontology/glossaries are checked against the authoritative domain literature, namely, Flora of North America and Flora of China. The evaluation results suggest that more work is needed to improve the coverage and interoperability of the ontology/glossaries. More concepts need to be added to the ontology/glossaries and careful work is needed to improve the semantic consistency. The method used in this paper to evaluate the ontology/glossaries can be used to propose new candidate concepts from the domain literature and suggest appropriate definitions.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Large volumes of morphological descriptions of whole organisms have been created as print or electronic text in a human-readable format. Converting the descriptions into computer- readable formats gives a new life to the valuable knowledge on biodiversity. Research in this area started 20 years ago, yet not sufficient progress has been made to produce an automated system that requires only minimal human intervention but works on descriptions of various plant and animal groups. This paper attempts to examine the hindering factors by identifying the mismatches between existing research and the characteristics of morphological descriptions. Results: This paper reviews the techniques that have been used for automated annotation, reports exploratory results on characteristics of morphological descriptions as a genre, and identifies challenges facing automated annotation systems. Based on these criteria, the paper proposes an overall strategy for converting descriptions of various taxon groups with the least human effort. Conclusions: A combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning strategy is needed to construct domain ontologies and lexicons and to ultimately achieve automated semantic annotation of morphological descriptions. Further, we suggest that each effort in creating a new description or annotating an individual description collection should be shared and contribute to the "biodiversity information commons" for the Semantic Web. This cannot be done without a sound strategy and a close partnership between and among information scientists and biologists.},

  Abstract                 = {The skeleton is of fundamental importance in research in comparative vertebrate morphology, paleontology, biomechanics, developmental biology, and systematics. Motivated by research questions that require computational access to and comparative reasoning across the diverse skeletal phenotypes of vertebrates, we developed a module of anatomical concepts for the skeletal system, the Vertebrate Skeletal Anatomy Ontology (VSAO), to accommodate and unify the existing skeletal terminologies for the species-specific (mouse, the frog Xenopus, zebrafish) and multispecies (teleost, amphibian) vertebrate anatomy ontologies. Previous differences between these terminologies prevented even simple queries across databases pertaining to vertebrate morphology. This module of upper-level and specific skeletal terms currently includes 223 defined terms and 179 synonyms that integrate skeletal cells, tissues, biological processes, organs (skeletal elements such as bones and cartilages), and subdivisions of the skeletal system. The VSAO is designed to integrate with other ontologies, including the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO), Gene Ontology (GO), Uberon, and Cell Ontology (CL), and it is freely available to the community to be updated with additional terms required for research. Its structure accommodates anatomical variation among vertebrate species in development, structure, and composition. Annotation of diverse vertebrate phenotypes with this ontology will enable novel inquiries across the full spectrum of phenotypic diversity.},

The method proposed here not only calculates the minimum number of weighings necessary, but also indicates how to perform these weighings, it is easily mechanizeable and valid for any number of coins. Instructions are also given as to how to generalize the procedure to include cases where there is more than one counterfeit coin.},

  Abstract                 = {The coordination of the eye movement control system with comprehension processes was studied. Eye movements were monitored while subjects read paragraphs containing an anaphoric noun phrase. In Experiment 1, fixations on the anaphoric noun were shorter when its antecedent was close and typical of the noun category than when it was distant and/or atypical. Subjects took longer reading the words following the anaphoric noun when the antecedent was atypical than when it was typical. In Experiment 2, distance of antecedent affected anaphor fixation times for category name anaphors but not for general noun anaphors (e.g., "object"). The results suggest that the eyes do not wait for the completion of anaphor resolution processes. Rather, these processes are completed after the eyes have left the anaphoric noun. The different patterns of effects on the anaphors themselves and the post-anaphor region were interpreted to reflect two different stages in anaphor resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Publish/subscribe represents a new paradigm for distributed content delivery. It provides an alternative to address-based communication due to its ability to decouple communication between the source and the destination. However, it has remained a challenge to devise a scalable overlay supporting expressive content-filtering while satisfying the desirable requirements large distributed systems should fulfill. Our goal is to build an efficient P2P publish/subscribe network where only interested nodes are involved in event dissemination, and the amount of overhead generated by network discovery and membership management is small. In order to do so, we use a Bloom filter based mapping scheme to map IDs to nodes' interests, in addition to a new interest proximity metric to forward events and to build nodes' routing tables. As for network discovery we propose a new approach we call ldquoshared interest approachrdquo. Our scheme ensures an upper bound of routing tables size that only depends on the size of the ID digest. To evaluate the algorithms proposed in this work we conducted simulations in both static and dynamic settings.},

  Abstract                 = {AIMS/BACKGROUND: Many reports have indicated that some patients with cataract can retain good visual acuity but complain of significant visual problems. This is the first in a series of papers trying to determine what causes these symptoms and whether other clinical tests can predict the real world vision loss. METHODS: The effect of a cataract simulation with a similar angular distribution of light scatter as real cataract on clinical (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and disability glare) and real world vision (face recognition, reading speed, and mobility orientation) was investigated. RESULTS: The simulation had a relatively small effect on visual acuity (6/6 with the simulation), but much larger effects on contrast sensitivity and low contrast acuity with and without glare. The simulation had no effect on high luminance and high contrast real world tasks, such as mobility orientation in room light and optimal reading speed. A small, but significant deterioration was found for the slightly lower contrast task of face and expression recognition. However, under low luminance conditions, substantial defects in mobility orientation were obtained (despite 6/6 acuity). CONCLUSIONS: Although the relative effect of the cataract simulation on acuity and contrast tasks is not typical of the average cataract, it can be found in those cataract patients with visual problems despite good visual acuity. This corroborates the suggestion that it is large amounts of wide angle light scatter (forward and/or backward) which are at least partly responsible for visual disability in cataract patients with good visual acuity. A patient's reported visual disability may depend on the percentage of time he or she spends under low contrast and/or low luminance conditions, such as walking or reading in dim illumination, and walking or driving at night, in fog, or heavy rain.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Sentence context increases reading speed relative to reading unrelated words. Previous studies of normal peripheral retina and in patients with central field loss (CFL) have come to different conclusions regarding the benefits of sentence context for reading in peripheral retina. Studies of normal peripheral vision presented the text to inferior visual field; it is presumed that most of the patients fixated using retina lateral to their scotoma. The goal of the current study was to determine whether the location of the text on the retina interacts with the usefulness of sentence context. METHODS: Normally sighted subjects read sentences and random lists of words presented at the fovea and at 50 to the left of and 50 inferior to fixation in visual field space. Texts were presented using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). RESULTS: The ratio of reading rates for sentences to random words (context gain) was the same in the inferior field (2.7 +/- 0.20) and at the fovea (2.6 +/- 0.26); context gain was greater in the left field (7.2 +/- 1.22). CONCLUSIONS: Sentence context increases reading speed regardless of the position of the text on the retina. Reading rates in peripheral retina are not decreased because of an inability to use sentence context.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: For most people with low vision, some form of magnification is necessary to read. Using a magnifier reduces the number of letters that can be seen simultaneously (field of view), which has been shown to decrease reading rates. This study sought to determine how many letters are necessary to attain maximal reading rates with a stand magnifier. METHODS: Younger and older normally-sighted and visually-impaired observers read short passages using a fiber optic stand magnifier (taper). The optical properties of this magnifier allowed the field of view to be precisely varied. Each subject read using at least four field sizes (3, 5, 9 and 13 characters visible) while reading speed was measured. RESULTS: Reading rates continued to increase with as many as 13 characters visible, regardless of age or vision status. In addition, reading with the taper was slower for all subject groups than reading without the magnifier. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms reports that reading rates increase as the field of view increases when reading from a page of text. The need for this large field of view relative to other low vision reading aids (i.e., computer-generated scroll displays) is likely the result of the readers' need to actively navigate across the page of text.},

Using this paradigm, we found that subjects with normal vision (n = 12) read faster with RSVP for all text sizes. Low vision subjects (N = 20) showed no benefit of RSVP until the text was at least 8x their acuity threshold. As in our prior studies, there was a great deal of variability within the low vision group, and for a small number of subjects (25\%), reading was faster from the scroll than from the RSVP display.},

Readers with CFL and normally sighted, age-matched controls read sentences and lists of random words from two dynamic text displays. We used sentence-gain (the ratio of reading rates for sentences to random words) to assess the use of context. Sentence-gain was equivalent across groups.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: As text is magnified, the number of letters that can be displayed with a magnifier or other reading aid at any one time (window size) is reduced. There is a great deal of evidence that reading rates increase as the number of letters displayed increases. The minimum number of proportionally spaced letters necessary to read at maximal rates from a scroll display, in which the text is continuously panned across a television screen, is not known. METHODS: Visually impaired (VI) and normally sighted (NA) observers were asked to read either sentences or random words scrolled across a computer screen. The window size was varied so that from one to 12 characters were visible, on average, at any one time. Each subject read with six different window sizes within the range of one to 12 characters visible. RESULTS: For the NA group, a window of four to five characters was necessary to read at maximal rates. VI subjects, as a group, required a significantly larger window of six to seven characters to reach maximal reading rates. CONCLUSIONS: The window size requirement for the NA group is close to the size other investigators have reported for a fixed-width font. However, the VI group required a larger window than did the NA group, which has not been previously reported. This requirement could result from the additional stimulation available with a larger window to entrain the eyes' motion when reading from a passively scrolled display.},

It has also been reported that similar enhancement could increase reading speeds by a factor of 2-4 in the same population [cf. Ophthalmology 96, 115 (1989)]. In our experiments we sought to determine what benefit, if any, was derived from spatial filtering of text for low-vision readers. Results from this series of studies indicate that 66\% of patients do increase their reading rate with enhancement, but this increase is small. Change in reading rate with spatial filtering ranged from a 100\% decrement to a 125\% improvement, with an average 13\% improvement. Only 10 of 67 subjects increased their reading rates by 50\% or more. The clinical information that we gathered does not allow us to predict accurately which patients will benefit from spatial filtering. On the basis of these findings we conclude that enhancement of text by spatial filtering does not substantially increase reading rates for most low-vision patients.},

Prior research has shown that both normally sighted and low-vision observers read text displayed to the same location, one word at a time [known as rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)], faster than a page of text. A similar comparison with text scrolled continuously across the screen also shows faster reading for low-vision patients, but the relative change from a standard page view is substantially less (15\% faster for the scroll display versus 80\% faster for RSVP). In this study we directly compared these techniques. For those with normal vision, reading from the RSVP display was 1.3 times faster than reading from the scroll display [t(9) = 3.32, P = 0.009]. Although the difference in reading rates for the visually impaired group did not reach statistical significance, as a group they read 13\% slower from the RSVP than from the scroll display.},

Unlike patients with central field loss (CFL), there was no decrease in the benefit of RSVP with reduced vision due to the cataract simulators. However, the usefulness of sentence-level context was reduced as visual acuity was reduced. In addition, older readers did not benefit as much from RSVP as younger readers, and many in the older group were unable to read using the more severe cataract simulators from either display format.

This study investigated the change in reading performance and reading eye movements when we simulated the two most common causes of low vision–central field loss and cataract–and their combination (scotoma + cataract). Three subjects read sentences with each of these simulated impairments at five different letter sizes. They required larger letters to read with the cataract or scotoma than they did with normal vision, and larger still to read with scotoma + cataract; the change in eye movements relative to normal vision was similar across conditions. When reading large letters (1.61 degrees), the cataract had almost no effect, while the scotoma and scotoma + cataract reduced reading rate for two of the subjects. The cataract had a greater impact on performance relative to normal vision for these same two subjects, while for the third subject the cataract had a greater impact with the scotoma in place. Cataract extraction tends to be postponed in patients with central field loss because it is not perceived to be beneficial. The findings from this study, as well as others, suggest that patients with central field loss would benefit from cataract extraction.},

Patients who have central field loss due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), most often adopt PRL adjacent to and to the left of their scotoma in visual field space. It has been hypothesized that this arrangement of PRL and scotoma would benefit reading. We tested this hypothesis by asking normally-sighted subjects to read with the left or right half of their visual field plus 3.2 degrees in the contralateral field masked from view. Letter identification, word identification, and reading were all slower when only the information in the left visual field was available. This was primarily due to the number of saccades required to successfully read to stimuli. These data imply that patients would be better off with PRL to the right of their scotoma than to the left for the purposes of reading.},

  Abstract                 = {Species inventories are essential for documenting global diversity and generating necessary material for taxonomic study and conservation planning. However, for inventories to be immediately relevant, the taxonomic process must reduce the time to describe and identify specimens. To address these concerns for the inventory of arthropods across the Malagasy region, we present here a collaborative approach to taxonomy where collectors, morphologists and DNA barcoders using cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) participate collectively in a team-driven taxonomic process. We evaluate the role of DNA barcoding as a tool to accelerate species identification and description. This revision is primarily based on arthropod surveys throughout the Malagasy region from 1992 to 2006. The revision is based on morphological and CO1 DNA barcode analysis of 500 individuals. In the region, five species of Anochetus (A. boltonisp. nov., A. goodmanisp. nov., A. grandidieri, and A. madagascarensis from Madagascar, and A. pattersonisp. nov. from Seychelles) and three species of Odontomachus (O. coquereli, O. troglodytes and O. simillimus) are recognized. DNA barcoding (using cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1)) facilitated caste association and type designation, and highlighted population structure associated with reproductive strategy, biogeographic and evolutionary patterns for future exploration. This study provides an example of collaborative taxonomy, where morphology is combined with DNA barcoding. We demonstrate that CO1 DNA barcoding is a practical tool that allows formalized alpha-taxonomy at a speed, detail, precision, and scale unattainable by employing morphology alone.},

The success of cladistics is claimed to be largely rooted in the parsimony-implementing congruence test. Cladists may use the congruence test to iteratively refine assessments of homology, and thereby increase the odds of reliable phylogenetic inference under parsimony. This explanation challenges alternative views which tend to ignore the effects of parsimony on the process of character individuation in systematics. In a related theme, the concept of homeostatic property cluster natural kinds is used to explain why cladistics is well suited to provide a traditional, verbal reference system for the evolutionary properties of species and clades. The advantages of more explicitly probabilistic approaches to phylogenetic inference appear to manifest themselves in situations where evolutionary homeostasis has for the most part broken down, and predictive classifications are no longer possible.},

In such contexts, it is crucial to grant access to the semantic model and its data only to the authorized users. In this paper, we present a fine-grained access control model specifically tailored to semantic models. One of the relevant features of the model is the granularity of the resources that can be protected. Access control can be enforced at the level of both the model's concepts and the concepts' instances by means of a query rewriting strategy. The proposed model has been implemented adopting the XACML standard and the SeRQL query language; services exposed by the implementation can be used to trans- paretly integrate authorization into existing systems.},

  Abstract                 = {In earlier work, Frazier and Rayner (1990) provided evidence for a processing principle termed the Minimal Semantic Commitment (MSC)hypothesis. In the present study, we used the MSC hypothesis as a starting point in addressing the issue of when to treat mental representations as vague versus determinate and ambiguous. Given ambiguous representations, the MSC hypothesis predicts that the processor will commit to one interpretation (the grammatical ambiguity hypothesis). On the other hand, given a single underspecified representation, the MSC hypothesis predicts that the processor will await disambiguating information before fully committing to an interpretation (the vagueness hypothesis). In an experiment designed to evaluate these hypotheses with respect to the representation of distributivity, participants' eye movements were recorded as they read sentences containing distributive or collective predicates that were either disambiguated by a preceding adverb or left locally ambiguous by delaying the disambiguating adverb until the end of the predicate. The results suggested that a semantic commitment is made in locally indeterminate cases as evidenced by a significant interaction of ambiguity and distributivity in first pass times, total times, and regressions. If the difficulty of distributives simply reflected the difficulty of postulating a distributive operator when evidence warranting it is encountered, then no interaction would be expected. Hence we argue that the distributive/collective distinction is treated as a matter of ambiguity rather than as one of vagueness. In the absence of evidence for a distributive reading, the processor commits itself to a collective reading sometime during the processing of the predicate (before the disambiguation in our late disambiguation examples). The findings are discussed in relation to recent linguistic work on the representation of distributivity.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Visual impairment is a risk factor for morbidity in the elderly and is often screened for by self-report. This study evaluates whether there are subsets for whom there is a discrepancy between self-reported and measured function. METHODS: The prevalence of a discrepancy between self-reported difficulty reading a newspaper and measured reading speed was determined in 2520 community-based men and women, aged 65 to 84 years, and the discrepant group characterized by polychotomous regression. RESULTS: Of subjects who reported minimal difficulty reading a newspaper, 10.8\% (227/2107) read newsprint-sized text (0.21 degrees) more slowly than 80 words/min, a level previously shown to be necessary for sustained reading. Poor visual acuity, presence of psychiatric symptoms, and less satisfaction with vision were associated with being in the group that read slowly and reported difficulty with reading. Better cognition, better visual acuity, more years of education, white race, and fewer psychiatric symptoms were associated with being in the group that read more quickly and reported minimal difficulty. When reading the text size at which subjects read their fastest, only 2.6\% of those with minimal difficulty remained discrepant. These individuals were more likely to have less education, be male, be African American, and have poorer cognitive status than those who did not remain discrepant. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of the elderly population have a substantial discrepancy between self-reported reading difficulty and measured reading speed. In some, this discrepancy may be based on underlying expectations and experiences, and in others it may represent a transition from no visual impairment to visual impairment.},

In addition to being a quantitative, intuitively interpretable measure of difference, the deviation between two datasets can also be computed very fast. Our framework covers a wide variety of models including frequent itemsets, decision tree classifiers, and clusters, and captures standard measures of deviation such as the misclassification rate and the chi-squared metric as special cases. We also show how statistical techniques can be applied to the deviation measure to assess whether the difference between two models is significant (i.e., whether the underlying datasets have statistically significant differences in their characteristics), and discuss several practical applications.},

We reanalyzed the data of O'Brien et al.

Two refinements to O'Brien et al.'s conclusions are offered. First, the two text characteristics they manipulated (a strong biasing context or a demand sentence) may have produced different types of elaborative inferencing. We argue that a biasing context results in a passive form of elaborative inferencing, involving setting up a context of interpretation, whereas the presence of a demand sentence invites the reader to actively predict a subsequent expression.

The experiments were performed in French instead of English, and compared the plural article 'les' with different three-letter verbs. It was confirmed that the eye did indeed move about 1.5 letters further in the case of the article 'les'. Further investigation of the phenomenon suggested that the effect was present even when the prior fixation duration was short: Only when prior fixation was around 200 ms or less, and additionally when the eye started from a launch position that was far from the word, was there a suggestion that the 'les'-skipping effect disappeared.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the issue of how to measure the degree to which a functional dependency (FD) is approximate. The primary motivation lies in the fact that approximate FDs represent potentially interesting patterns existent in a table. Their discovery is a valuable data mining problem. However, before algorithms can be developed, a measure must be defined quantifying their approximation degree. First we develop an approximation measure by axiomatizing the following intuition: the degree to which XY is approximate in a table T is the degree to which T determines a function from ΠX(T) to ΠY(T). We prove that a unique unnormalized measure satisfies these axioms up to a multiplicative constant. Next we compare the measure developed with two other measures from the literature. In all but one case, we show that the measures can be made to differ as much as possible within normalization. We examine these measure on several real datasets and observe that many of the theoretically possible extreme differences do not bear themselves out. We offer some conclusions as to particular situations where certain measures are more appropriate than others.},

Four families and three clumps found in this work show a size distribution which is compatible with a formation due to a cratering event on the largest member of the family, and also three families have B- or related taxonomic types members, which represents a 14\% of the B-types classified by Bus and Binzel [2002.

The higher frequency neighbor differed from the stimulus word by either the second letter (e.g., ASTRE-AUTRE) or the fourth letter (CHOPE-CHOSE). Neighborhood frequency effects were found to interact with this factor, and significant interference was observed only to CHOPE-type words. The effects of neighborhood frequency were also found to interact with the position of initial fixation in the stimulus word (either the second letter or the fourth letter). Interference was greatly reduced when the initial fixation was on the critical disambiguating letter (i.e., the letter P in CHOPE). Moreover, word recognition was improved when subjects initially fixated the second letter relative to when they initially fixated the fourth letter of a five-letter word, but this second-letter advantage practically disappeared when the stimulus differed from a more frequent word by its fourth letter. The results are interpreted in terms of the interaction between visual and lexical factors in visual work recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Current models of word recognition generally assume that word units orthographically similar to a stimulus word are involved in the visual recognition of this word. We refer to this set of orthographically similar words as an orthographic neighborhood. Two experiments are presented that investigate the ways in which the composition of this neighborhood can affect word recognition. The data indicate that the presence in the neighborhood of at least one unit of higher frequency than the stimulus word itself results in interference in stimulus word processing. Lexical decision latencies (Experiment 1) and gaze durations (Experiment 2) to words with one neighbor of higher frequency were significantly longer than to words without a more frequent neighbor. This neighborhood frequency effect is discussed in terms of the different types of candidate selection process postulated by contemporary models of visual word recognition.},

In the majority of cases the fixation was located on the left part, or the inferior part of the visual field relative to the central scotoma. The fact that the inferior visual field is used is coherent with the notion that the lower visual field is important for locomotion. However the preferential use of the left field appears contradictory with data showing superiority of visual faculties in the right visual field. This result may possibly be explained in relation to the need for left-to-right readers to monitor where their eyes have landed relative to the word previously fixated on the left.},

  Abstract                 = {The determination of cell fates during the assembly of the ommatidia in the compound eye of Drosophila appears to be controlled by cell-cell interactions. In this process, the sevenless gene is essential for the development of a single type of photoreceptor cell. In the absence of proper sevenless function the cells that would normally become the R7 photoreceptors instead become nonneuronal cells. Previous morphological and genetic analysis has indicated that the product of the sevenless gene is involved in reading or interpreting the positional information that specifies this particular developmental pathway. The sevenless gene has now been isolated and characterized. The data indicate that sevenless encodes a transmembrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain. This structural similarity between sevenless and certain hormone receptors suggests that similar mechanisms are involved in developmental decisions based on cell-cell interaction and physiological or developmental changes induced by diffusible factors.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the minimum entropy principle for learning data generated by a random source and observed with random noise. In our setting we have a sequence of observations of objects drawn uniformly at random from a population. Each object in the population belongs to one class. We perform an observation for each object which determines that it belongs to one of a given set of classes. Given these observations, we are interested in assigning the most likely class to each of the objects. This scenario is a very natural one that appears in many real life situations. We show that under reasonable assumptions finding the most likely assignment is equivalent to the following variant of the set cover problem. Given a universe U and a collection of subsets of U, we wish to find an assignment such that u[set membership, variant]f(u) and the entropy of the distribution defined by the values f-1(Si) is minimized. We show that this problem is NP-hard and that the greedy algorithm for set cover s with an additive constant error with respect to the optimal cover. This sheds a new light on the behavior of the greedy set cover algorithm. We further enhance the greedy algorithm and show that the problem admits a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Finally, we demonstrate how this model and the greedy algorithm can be useful in real life scenarios, and in particular, in problems arising naturally in computational biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity informatics plays a central enabling role in the research community's efforts to address scientific conservation and sustainability issues. Great strides have been made in the past decade establishing a framework for sharing data, where taxonomy and systematics has been perceived as the most prominent discipline involved. To some extent this is inevitable, given the use of species names as the pivot around which information is organised. To address the urgent questions around conservation, land-use, environmental change, sustainability, food security and ecosystem services that are facing Governments worldwide, we need to understand how the ecosystem works. So, we need a systems approach to understanding biodiversity that moves significantly beyond taxonomy and species observations. Such an approach needs to look at the whole system to address species interactions, both with their environment and with other species.It is clear that some barriers to progress are sociological, basically persuading people to use the technological solutions that are already available. This is best addressed by developing more effective systems that deliver immediate benefit to the user, hiding the majority of the technology behind simple user interfaces. An infrastructure should be a space in which activities take place and, as such, should be effectively invisible.This community consultation paper positions the role of biodiversity informatics, for the next decade, presenting the actions needed to link the various biodiversity infrastructures invisibly and to facilitate understanding that can support both business and policy-makers. The community considers the goal in biodiversity informatics to be full integration of the biodiversity research community, including citizens' science, through a commonly-shared, sustainable e-infrastructure across all sub-disciplines that reliably serves science and society alike.},

  Abstract                 = {Most people with low vision need magnification to read. Page navigation is the process of moving a magnifier during reading. Modern electronic technology can provide many alternatives for navigating through text. This study compared reading speeds for four methods of displaying text. The four methods varied in their page-navigation demands. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) and MOUSE methods involved manual navigation. The DRIFT method (horizontally drifting text) involved no manual navigation, but did involve both smooth-pursuit and saccadic eye movements. The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) method involved no manual navigation, and relatively few eye movements. There were 7 normal subjects and 12 low-vision subjects (7 with central-field loss, CFL group, and 5 with central fields intact, CFI group). The subjects read 70-word passages at speeds that yielded good comprehension. Taking the CCTV reading speed as a benchmark, neither the normal nor low-vision subjects had significantly different speeds with the MOUSE method. As expected from the reduced navigational demands, normal subjects read faster with the DRIFT method (85\% faster) and the RSVP method (169\%). The CFI group read significantly faster with DRIFT (43\%) and RSVP (38\%). The CFL group showed no significant differences in reading speed for the four methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Annotations allow users to associate additional information with existing resources. Using proprietary and closed systems on the Web, users are already able to annotate multimedia resources such as images, audio and video. So far, however, this information is almost always kept locked up and inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. This should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via common Web standards. We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration, an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.},

The objectives of the Project are to facilitate access to online flora and fauna by both novices and experts through enhanced indexing, searching, and visualization techniques. Specific search facility and content will be added to help users with different levels of domain knowledge identify species based on the augmentation of professionally developed taxonomic treatments or species descriptions. This is a novel use of taxonomic descriptions. In the course of development the system will undergo a series of qualitative and quantitative evaluations and re-designs by several communities of users, including professional entomologists and botanists as well as citizen scientists performing biodiversity surveys.},

We have developed Morpho, a data management application designed to assist researchers in managing this heterogeneous collection of ecological data. Our goal in developing Morpho was to ease the burden of data management on scientists while improving access to and documentation for ecological data. Morpho allows ecological researchers to describe their data using a comprehensive and flexible metadata specification,and to share their data publicly or to specific collaborators over the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB).Morpho's main features include: (1) flexible metadata creation and editing using an XML syntax for metadata exchange; (2) a 'wizard' interface for collecting metadata; (3) automated metadata extraction while importing data; (4) an XML editor that is configurable using multiple XML DTDs; (5) compliance with the Ecological Metadata Language; (6) powerful metadata search on the network or locally; and, (7) comprehensive revision control for data and metadata.}

  Abstract                 = {Eye movements were monitored during the reading of spatially transformed text in order to examine covert attentional processes in reading. In some conditions, the sequence of letters within a word was congruent with (i.e. in the same direction as) the sequence of words in the sentence; in other conditions the direction of letters within words and the direction of words in the sentence were incongruent. In addition, the window of visible text was varied so that in some conditions only the fixated word (and all preceding words) were visible, whereas in other conditions the fixated word and the succeeding word were both visible. Readers were able to extract more parafoveal information from text when the words themselves were normal than when the letters within the words were transformed. However, with practice, readers were able to use some parafoveal information even when the words were transformed. The most important finding was that the congruity of the word and letter order had no reliable effect on the ability to extract parafoveal information and influenced reading performance only when the words themselves were normal. We conclude that covert attention in reading is not a letter-by-letter scan that sweeps across the page, but either an asymmetric spotlight held constant on each fixation or a shifting of an attentional spotlight extending across multiletter units (possibly words) with the direction of shifts of attention closely coupled to the direction of eye movements.},

  Abstract                 = {Eye movements were recorded while subjects read passages of text repeatedly (Experiment 1) and while normal text and strings of homogeneous letters were fixated (Experiment 2). Text repetition decreased fixation durations and increased saccade size, presumably because it decreased attention demands. Irrespective of repetition, however, no distinct distribution of brief (express) fixations emerged. In Experiment 2, fixation durations were shorter and saccades were larger when strings of homogeneous letters were "read," indicating that this condition decreased attention demands. Again, however, no distinct distribution of express fixations emerged. These findings pose problems for the view that attentional processes determine the occurrence of brief (express) fixation durations in reading. Supplementary analyses of Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that visuospatial processing affected fixation durations, irrespective of linguistic processing demands.},

Specifically, the studies examined whether participants detected the substitution of a homophone mate for a contextually appropriate homophone. The frequency of the incorrect homophone, the frequency of the correct homophone, and the predictability of the correct homophone were manipulated. Also, the impact of reading skill was examined. When correct homophones were not predictable and participants had a range of reading abilities, the evidence indicated that phonology plays a role in activating the meanings of low-frequency words only. When the performance of good and poor readers was examined separately, the evidence indicated that good readers primarily activate the meanings of words using the direct route, whereas poor readers primarily activate the meanings of words using the phonological route.},

  Abstract                 = {In the domain of biological classification, classifications are performed hierarchically. There are no standard classifications which are unanimously accepted by the community of each domain; many different interacting views of classification exist about the same data, and the discovery of new data results in changes to the existing classification. Even a single individual may change his or her own classification of a particular group. Since multiple classification views interact, they are semantically related. It is difficult to model this kind of dynamically evolving and semantically interacting classification system using traditional data models, which lack the structural flexibility necessary to support dynamic views of hierarchic classifications, and cannot properly capture the history of these complex interactions. We have developed a new data model which is suitable for supporting semantically interacting dynamic views of hierarchic biological classifications. On the basis of our new data model we have developed a prototype database system called HICLAS (HIerarchical CLAssification System); its domain is plant taxonomy. HICLAS is available through the Internet and an X-window interface has been implemented to support queries to classification data.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores the intensity of processing during sentence comprehension by measuring pupillary response during reading. Two experiments contrast the processing of simpler versus more complex sentences. The two more complex sentence types, object-relative center-embedded sentences and filler-gap sentences, not only take longer to process than their simpler counterparts, but they also produce a larger change in pupil diameter. We propose that the pupillary response is an indicator of how intensely the processing system is operating. The more complex sentences evoke some intense processing at the point in the sentence where a syntactic complexity is first encountered. The gaze durations at these points are elevated, indicating the immediate response to the demand of the syntactic processing. The pupil then starts to dilate, reaching a maximal diameter approximately 1.3 s later. The results from these various performance measures are integrated within a resource-limited computational model of comprehension. The paper develops a model of comprehension that includes an intensity dimension of thought, drawing a correspondence between the computational model's consumption of resources and the human pupillary response.},

Some of the evidence supporting the theory is questioned by G.S. Waters and D. Caplan (1996a). This article identifies some of Waters and Caplan's errors about the empirical support in Just and Carpenter (1992), evaluates Waters and Caplan's alternative hypothesis, and presents the results of a new neuroimaging study that supports capacity theory and not Waters and Caplan's separate resources hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {This article compares several methods of presenting text, including a new paradigm that produces reading-time data with many of the characteristics of naturally occurring eye-fixation data. In the new paradigm, called the moving window condition, a reader presses a button to see each successive work in a text, and the previous work is removed when a new work appears. The words appear in the same position that they would in normal test, and word-length information is available in peripheral vision. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the results obtained by monitoring the eye fixations of subjects reading normal text. The word-level effects are generally similar. Readers pause longer on longer words, on less frequent words, on words that introduce a new topic, and at ends of sentences. The results suggest that readers initiate thr processing of each word as soon as they encounter it rather than buffer words and delay processing. Also considered are two other reading-time paradigms, one in which words are cumulatively displayed on the screen and one in which each successive word is presented at the same location on the screen. Finally, we consider how the tendency to immediately process text might interact with other techniques for text presentation, such as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) condition, and we generate predictions about the nature and limits of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: People in need of low vision rehabilitation services often experience delays in referral to services. This study investigates referral criteria of Australian ophthalmologists, the frequency of referral of their patients with low vision and their perceptions of low vision services. METHODS: A survey was sent to a representative, random sample of 200 ophthalmologists. They were asked about criteria used for the referral of their patients with low vision. The survey included questions on the frequency with which they prescribed low vision devices (LVD) and referral of their patients to low vision and rehabilitation services and peer support groups. Perceptions of the quality and availability of low vision services were also investigated. RESULTS: The response rate was 82\%. Approximately 11\% of ophthalmologists' patients have low vision. It is uncommon for ophthalmologists to prescribe LVD but 67\% refer most of their patients with low vision. It is less common for them to refer to rehabilitation services (29\%) or peer support services (18\%). The perceived local availability of services influences the rate of referral. Ophthalmologists who used the criteria of moderate low vision ({\textless} 6/21 to {\textless} 6/60) are more likely to refer more of their patients than those who use the criteria of severe low vision. CONCLUSIONS: Australian ophthalmologists refer most of their visually impaired patients to low vision services, but infrequently to rehabilitation services or peer support groups. Differences in perceived need for low vision services indicated by the criteria used for referral, and the perceived availability, influence the rate at which ophthalmologists refer their patients for services. Ophthalmologists are encouraged to refer patients with permanent visual loss to low vision services earlier.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges to functional neuroimaging is to understand how the component processes of reading comprehension emerge from the neural activity in a network of brain regions. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine lexical and syntactic processing in reading comprehension by independently manipulating the cognitive demand on each of the two processes of interest. After establishing a consistency with earlier research showing the involvement of the left perisylvian language areas in both lexical access and syntactic processing, the study produced new findings that are surprising in two ways: (i) the lexical and syntactic factors each impact not just individual areas, but they affect the activation in a network of left-hemisphere areas, suggesting that changing the computational load imposed by a given process produces a cascade of effects in a number of collaborating areas; and (ii) the lexical and syntactic factors usually interact in determining the amount of activation in each affected area, suggesting that comprehension processes that operate on different levels of language may nevertheless draw on a shared infrastructure of cortical resources. The results suggest that many processes in sentence comprehension involve multiple brain regions, and that many brain regions contribute to more than one comprehension process. The implication is that the language network consists of brain areas which each have multiple relative specializations and which engage in extensive interarea collaborations.},

  Abstract                 = {For each j ≥ 1, if Tj is the finite rooted binary tree with 2j leaves, the hierarchical type class of binary string x of length 2j is obtained by placing the entries of x as labels on the leaves of Tj and then forming all permutations of x according to the permutations of the leaf labels under all isomorphisms of tree Tj into itself. The set of binary strings of length 2j is partitioned into hierarchical type classes, and in each such class, all of the strings have the same type (n0j,n1j), where n0j,n1j are respectively the numbers of zeroes and ones in the strings. Let p(n0j,n1j) be the probability vector (n0j/2j, n1j/2j) belonging to the set P2 of all two-dimensional probability vectors. For each j ≥ 1, and each of the 2j + 1 possible types (n0j,n1j), a hierarchical type class S(n0j,n1j) is specified. Conditions are investigated under which there will exist a function h : P2 → [0, ∞) such that for each p ∈ P2, if (n0j,n1j) : j ≥ 1 is any sequence of types for which p(n0j,n1j) → p, then the sequence 2-j log2(card(S(n0j,n1j))) : j ≥ 1 converges to h(p). Such functions h, called hierarchical entropy functions, play the same role in hierarchical type class coding theory that the Shannon entropy function on P2 does in traditional type class coding theory, except that there are infinitely many hierarchical entropy functions but only one Shannon entropy - - function. One of the hierarchical entropy functions h that is studied is a self-affine function for which a closed-form expression is obtained making use of an iterated function system whose attractor is the graph of h.},

Word meanings are activated, propositions are formed, and inferences and elaborations are produced without regard to the discourse context. However, a network of interrelated items is created in this manner, which can be integrated into a coherent structure through a spreading activation process. Data concerning the time course of word identification in a discourse context are examined. A simulation of arithmetic word-problem understanding provides a plausible account for some well-known phenomena in this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

The paradigm provides decoupling in time, space, and synchronization for interacting entities and several variants of publish/subscribe exists including topic-based, subject-based, and type-based publish/subscribe. A central issue in implementing publish/subscribe-based systems is for entities to agree on a common vocabulary. To support this, we present a conceptualization and a design of a publish/subscribe system that combine and generalize many of these paradigms by using Semantic Web technology. In doing so, we extend previous work on ontology-based publish/subscribe by describing the semantics of publish/subscribe using operations on ontologies and by using common Semantic Web technology. Furthermore, we present an implementation in the context of a middleware we are designing and show that this implementation has adequate performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Disjoint principal component analysis is a statistical method useful for identifying unknown plant specimens. The method uses measurements on a number of quantitative or qualitative characters to construct a set of disjoint principal component models, one for each of several known taxa. Using linear regression, measurements of the same characters made on unknown specimens are fit to each model in turn, and F-statistics are used to determine to which taxa the unknowns should be assigned. A step by step procedure for carrying out disjoint principal component analysis is described, and an example is presented in which the method is used to identify a type specimen of Aster. Disjoint principal component analysis has five desirable attributes, not all of which are possessed by any other statistical identification method. Disjoint principal component analysis: 1) supplies a model for each known taxon based not only on a mean vector but also on a hyperplane representing the variability typically found in the taxon, 2) provides an objective statistical criterion (a statistical hypothesis test) for assigning a specimen to a taxon, 3) inherently allows for the possibility that a specimen may not belong to any of the known taxa, 4) indicates explicitly, by means of hypothesis tests, when the data are inadequate for unambiguous identification, and 5) supplies a method for double-checking the identification of known specimens. Although the most obvious use of disjoint principal component analysis is in systematics, the method is actually completely general and can be utilized in any situation where an unclassified object (e.g., anatomical structure, specimen, species, habitat, community) is to be identified as belonging to one of a number of different classes or categories based on a set of measured characteristics.},

The GBIF has collected over 200 million records formally describing natural history specimens from hundreds of sources, while also serving the rapidly growing online community of amateur field observers. The two organizations face challenges arising from ambiguity of taxonomic names and the need to make voluminous and critical historical collections available and to develop standard metadata vocabularies that can be understood and used by all. The combination of science informatics tools, including a robust vocabulary and linked data conventions, with a networked, active user community will enable effective biodiversity data management over the long term.},

The results suggest that the early visual machinery which underlies word recognition is the same across the visual field apart from a change in scale, whilst the periphery is qualitatively inferior to the fovea at interpreting sentences with meaning.},

  Abstract                 = {The scientific names of plants and animals play a major role in Life Sciences as information is indexed, integrated, and searched using scientific names. The main problem with names is their ambiguous nature, because more than one name may point to the same taxon and multiple taxa may share the same name. In addition, scientific names change over time, which makes them open to various interpretations. Applying machine-understandable semantics to these names enables efficient processing of biological content in information systems. The first step is to use unique persistent identifiers instead of name strings when referring to taxa. The most commonly used identifiers are Life Science Identifiers (LSID), which are traditionally used in relational databases, and more recently HTTP URIs,},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To re-evaluate definitions of low vision, visual impairment, and disability. METHODS: We review current definitions of legal blindness and low vision and how these definitions are variably based on disability or impairment. We argue for a definite distinction being made between criteria for visual impairment and visual disability, low vision being defined as the presence of a visual impairment that results in a disability. Visual impairment is defined according to population norms and a statistical cut-off is used. Visual disability is defined by consideration of the level of visual measures which result in measurable or reportable disability. We consider the evidence that contrast sensitivity should be a criterion for visual disability in addition to visual acuity and visual field. CONCLUSIONS: According to the current information, we define visual impairment as best monocular or binocular visual acuity {\textless}(worse than) 6/7.5, total horizontal visual field {\textless}146 degrees (Goldmann III-4e) or {\textless}109 degrees (III-3e), and contrast sensitivity {\textless}1.5 (PelliRobson); we define visual disability as best monocular or binocular visual acuity {\textless}6/12 or contrast sensitivity {\textless}1.05.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To quantify the crowding effect with eccentric stimuli and to determine the relative contribution of neural interaction and attention to crowding in central and eccentric vision. METHODS: Monocular visual acuity was measured with computer-generated tumbling E and Landolt C targets presented centrally or at 2 degrees in the right visual field. Crowding distractors were designed to cause increasing contour interaction or increasing need for focused attention. A four-alternative forced-choice method of constant stimuli was used. In experiment 2 the distance between the target and the distractors was varied. RESULTS: Data are presented in terms of normalized visual acuity. Crowding in central vision was minimal, mainly caused by contour interaction, and did not occur with distractors more than four stroke widths distant. Crowding in eccentric vision was far greater in magnitude and extent (occurring for distractors as far as 16 stroke widths distant) and was caused by contour interaction and attentional factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that eccentric vision differs quantitatively and qualitatively from central vision. The extent of contour interaction effects are consistent with the proposed size of cortical processing zones. The results are discussed with reference to current theories of preattentive and attentive tasks and with reference to subjects with low vision due to central scotoma who use an eccentric retinal locus for fixation.},

Generally, patients with anterior sector conditions showed improved performance with band-pass filters (not with ND filters). It is suggested that the filter reduces the scatter within the ocular media. People with retinitis pigmentosa or diabetic retinopathy rarely benefited. The CPF 511 most frequently improved VA followed by CPF 527 and 550 respectively. We suggest that a condition of glare is incorporated when assessing suitability with tints.},

Yet we know little about the validity of these charts, i.e. which region of the spatial frequency spectrum is being measured. In this study we aimed to determine the validity of currently available CS charts by comparison against oscilloscope-based CS. We also determined their relative ability to predict reading speed. METHODS: CS was measured with five commercially available charts and the contrast sensitivity function was determined with sinusoidal gratings presented on a Joyce screen using a two-alternative forced choice staircase technique in 36 observers with low vision and 3 with normal vision. Reading rate was also measured with the subject reading with his or her own optical low vision aid. RESULTS: The results show that the Pelli-Robson chart and the Cambridge gratings are good measures of medium to low spatial frequencies, as would be predicted from their design, while the Regan and UW charts correlated with medium to high frequencies. The Vistech chart was a good predictor of CS at each spatial frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The best chart test of CS depends on which region of the CS curve is of interest. All the charts were good predictors of reading rate.},

It was found that both reading rate and accuracy were repeatable measures. Reading rates were found to be correlated with contrast sensitivity at 0.5 c/deg (r = 0.62). Multiple regression analysis also showed that the best predictor of reading rate was contrast sensitivity at 0.5 c/deg and that no other components of the contrast sensitivity function helped to explain more of the variance. This indicates that primarily low spatial frequencies are necessary for reading with optical low vision aids, as has been found previously for reading with a close circuit TV system.},

In this paradigm, when readers fixate on a specified target word region, a prime word is encountered for a brief duration at the beginning of the fixation and then it is replaced by a target word. Three types of primes were employed: homophones, semantically related, and orthographically similar, and five prime durations were employed: 29, 32, 35, 38, and 41 msec. The primary finding was that significant homophone priming was obtained at prime durations ranging from 29 to 35 msec, whereas significant semantic priming occurred only at the 32-msec prime duration. In contrast, significant orthographic priming occurred at all prime durations. These findings indicate that phonological codes are activated during an eye fixation at least as rapidly as semantic codes. An explanation for the pattern of events is suggested using the framework of an activation-verification model.},

Phonological priming was assessed by the difference in the gaze duration on the target word between when the prime was a homophone and when it was a control word equated with the homophone on orthographic similarity to the target. Both experiments demonstrated homophonic priming with prime durations of about 35 ms, but only for high-frequency word primes, indicating that lexicality was guiding the speed of the extraction of phonological codes early in a fixation. Evidence was also obtained for orthographic priming, and the data suggest that orthographic and phonological priming effects interact in a mutually facilitating manner.},

The shrinking visual span hypothesis attributes reading deficits in low vision, and slow reading in normal vision at low contrast, to a reduction in the visual span. This hypothesis predicts that reading time (msec/word) becomes increasingly dependent on word length as text contrast decreases. We tested and confirmed this prediction using the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) method. Estimates of the visual span ranged from about 10 characters for high-contrast text to less than two characters for low-contrast text. Eye-movement recordings showed that longer reading times at low contrast are partitioned about equally between prolonged fixation times and an increased number of saccades (presumably related to a reduced visual span). RSVP measurements for six out of seven low-vision subjects revealed a strong dependence of reading time on word length, as expected from reduced visual spans.},

In the model, the concept of the visual span (the number of letters that can be identified in a single fixation) plays a key, unifying role. The behavior of the model provides a computational framework for reexamining the literature on human reading saccades. Emergent properties of the model, such as regressive saccades and an optimal-viewing position, suggest new interpretations of human behavior. Because Mr. Chip's "retina" can have any (one-dimensional) arrangement of high-resolution regions and scotomas, the model can simulate common visual disorders. Surprising saccade strategies are linked to the pattern of scotomas. For example, Mr. Chips sometimes plans a saccade that places a decisive letter in a scotoma.

We propose that the size of the visual span - the number of letters recognizable in a glance - imposes a fundamental limit on reading speed, and that shrinkage of the visual span in peripheral vision accounts for slower peripheral reading. In Experiment 1, we estimated the size of the visual span in the lower visual field by measuring RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) reading times as a function of word length. The size of the visual span decreased from at least 10 letters in central vision to 1.7 letters at 15 degrees eccentricity, in good agreement with the corresponding reduction of reading speed measured by Chung and coworkers (Chung, S.

In Exp. 2, we measured letter recognition for trigrams (random strings of three letters) as a function of their position on horizontal lines passing through fixation (central vision) or displaced downward into the lower visual field (5, 10 and 20 degrees ). We also varied trigram presentation time. We used these data to construct visual-span profiles of letter accuracy versus letter position. These profiles were used as input to a parameter-free model whose output was RSVP reading speed. A version of this model containing a simple lexical-matching rule accounted for RSVP reading speed in central vision. Failure of this version of the model in peripheral vision indicated that people rely more on lexical inference to support peripheral reading. We conclude that spatiotemporal characteristics of the visual span limit RSVP reading speed in central vision, and that shrinkage of the visual span results in slower reading in peripheral vision.},

  Abstract                 = {Text can be depicted by luminance contrast (i.e., differences in luminance between characters and background) or by color contrast (i.e., differences in chromaticity). We used a psychophysical method to measure the reading speeds of eight normal and ten low-vision subjects for text displayed on a color monitor. Reading speed was measured as a function of luminance contrast, color contrast (derived from mixtures of red and green), and combinations of the two. When color contrast is high, normal subjects can read as rapidly as with high luminance contrast (greater than 300 words/min). Curves of reading speed versus contrast have the same shape for the two forms of contrast and are superimposed when contrast is measured in multiples of a threshold value. When both color and luminance contrast are present, there is no sign of additive interaction, and performance is determined by the form of contrast yielding the highest reading rate. Our findings suggest that color contrast and luminance contrast are coded in similar ways in the visual system but that the neural signals used in letter recognition are carried by different pathways for color and luminance. We found no advantages of color contrast for low-vision reading. For text composed of 6 degrees characters, all low-vision subjects read better with luminance contrast than with color contrast.},

It is the first in a series devoted to the psychophysics of reading with normal and low vision. We have measured reading rates for text scanned across the face of a TV monitor while varying parameters that are important in current theories of pattern vision. Our results provide estimates of the stimulus parameters required for optimal reading of scanned text. We have found that maximum reading rates are achieved for characters subtending 0.3 degree to 2 degrees. Contrast polarity (black-on-white vs white-on-black text) has no effect. Reading rate increases with field size, but only up to 4 characters, independent of character size. When text is low-pass spatial-frequency filtered, reading rate increases with bandwidth, but only up to two cycles/character, independent of character size. When text is matrix sampled, reading rate increases with sample density, but only up to a critical sample density which depends on character size. The critical sample density increases from about 4 X 4 samples/character for 0.1 degree characters to more than 20 X 20 samples/character for 24 degrees characters. We suggest that one spatial-frequency channel suffices for reading.},

  Abstract                 = {Clinicians need to estimate how well their low-vision patients will perform everyday visual tasks such as reading or driving. Typically, it is not practical to measure task performance directly or to administer a lengthy series of special tests. Recent laboratory research has suggested that some routine clinical data may be useful in predicting reading performance. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a promising set of simple measures–Snellen acuity, status of the central fields and ocular media, diagnosis, and age–could be used in a clinical setting to predict reading speed. One hundred and forty one patients who entered the low-vision clinic of the Minneapolis Society for the Blind received thorough eye examinations and a test of reading speed. Snellen acuity accounted for only 10\% of the variance in reading speeds overall, but played a more important role for subjects with central loss. Age was a better predictor than acuity. A diagnosis of age-related maculopathy predicted slower reading speed than other causes of central-field loss, but the difference was attributed to age. Media status (clear or cloudy) had no predictive value. Our set of clinical predictors accounted for only about 30\% of the variance in low-vision reading speeds. While data from more detailed visual testing might improve prediction, nonvisual factors such as age probably also contribute to the variance. Rather than relying on predictions from visual testing, clinical assessment of low-vision reading may be accomplished most easily with a suitably designed reading test.},

In this paper, we describe a new test of reading rate that uses static text, called the Minnesota Low-Vision Reading Test (MNread). It is microcomputer-based, and more easily set up and administered than the drifting-text procedure. It is of potential value as a standardized psychophysical test of reading and should be useful in research, clinical, and educational applications. Some types of low-vision aids rely on drifting text and others on static text. Is reading performance different for these two modes of text presentation? We measured reading rate as a function of angular character size for normal and low-vision subjects with drifting and static text. Although reading rates were highly correlated for the two modes of text presentation, normal subjects usually read static text more rapidly. The reverse was true for low-vision subjects; their reading rates for drifting text were slightly higher (average 15\%) than for static text.},

  Abstract                 = {Does the color of text influence its legibility? There are reasons why it may do so for specific groups of low-vision observers. We used psychophysical methods to measure the effects of wavelength on the reading performance of four normal observers, two dichromats, and twenty-five low-vision observers. Reading rates were measured for text scanned across the face of a television (TV) monitor. We compared performance under four luminance-matched conditions in which sets of neutral-density and Wratten color filters were placed in front of the TV screen–blue (lambda max = 430 nm), green (lambda max = 550 nm), red (lambda max = 650 nm), and gray. Under photopic conditions, the reading rates of normal subjects were independent of wavelength, with the exception of characters near the acuity limit. At lower luminances, wavelength effects could be explained by the shift from photopic to scotopic vision. It was hypothesized that light scatter or absorption in eyes with cloudy ocular media would result in depressed performance in the blue. Only one of seven subjects demonstrated this effect, which we traced to wavelength-specific absorption. Observers with advanced photoreceptor disorders tended to read blue text faster than red text. This could not be explained on the basis of photopic spectral sensitivities alone. Finally, the presence of central or peripheral field loss was not predictive of wavelength-specific effects in reading. On the whole, wavelength only occasionally plays a significant role in reading. When it does, performance tends to be depressed either in the red or the blue and to be nearly optimal for green or gray.},

We measured reading rate as a function of the contrast and character size of text for subjects with normal vision. Reading rates were highest (about 350 words/min) for letters ranging in size from 0.25 degree to 2 degrees. Within this range, reading was very tolerant to contrast reduction–for 1 degree letters, reading rate decreased by less than a factor of two for a tenfold reduction in contrast. The results were very similar for white-on-black and black-on-white text. Reading rate declined more rapidly for very small (less than 0.25 degree) and very large (greater than 2 degrees) letters. People with low vision usually require large characters to read, so high contrast is particularly important for them. Taking 35 words/min to be a threshold for reading, we constructed a contrast-sensitivity function (CSF) for reading. We were able to relate the shape of this CSF to the shape of sine-wave grating CSFs.},

  Abstract                 = {Very little is known about the effects of visual impairment on reading. We used psychophysical methods to study reading by 16 low-vision observers. Reading rates were measured for text scanned across the face of a TV monitor while varying parameters that are likely to be important in low vision: angular character size, number of characters in the field, number of dots composing each character, contrast polarity (white-on-black vs black-on-white text), and character spacing. Despite diverse pathologies and degrees of vision loss in our sample, several major generalizations emerged. There is a wide variation in peak reading rates among low-vision observers, but 64\% of the variance can be accounted for by two major distinctions: intact central fields vs central-field loss and cloudy vs clear ocular media. Peak reading rates for observers with central-field loss were very low (median 25 words/minute), while peak reading rates for observers with intact central fields were at least 90 words/minute (median 130 words/minute). Most low-vision readers require magnification to obtain characters of optimal size. Sloan M acuity was a better predictor of optimal character size than Snellen acuity, accounting for 72\% of the variance. Low-vision reading is similar to normal reading in several respects. For example, both show the same dependence on the number of characters in the field. Our results provide estimates of the best reading performance to be expected from low-vision observers with characteristic forms of vision loss, and the stimulus parameters necessary for optimal performance. These results will be useful in the development of clinical tests of low vision, and in the design of low-vision reading aids.},

  Abstract                 = {New advances in animation, scientific visualization, and graphical user interfaces make it essential that graphic design have advice about how to provide interfaces that mesh with users capabilities. The purpose of the dissertation is to gather what we know from cognitive psychology about graphical perception and put it in a computer program useful for designers of graphical displays. A computer program, UCIE (an acronym for Understanding Cognitive Information Engineering), simulates the mechanisms that underlie graphical perception. UCIE predicts the time it will take someone to answer a question from a graph or table. UCIE assumes the viewer follows a logical path of eye movements, called a semantic trace, to retrieve information from the graphical display. UCIE predicts total time by adding the times from the individual perceptual and cognitive components. Graph type and question type determine which component tasks are involved. UCIE moves beyond the current level of understanding by providing more detail about potential interactions among the component tasks in visual perception and cognition. UCIE has undergone rigorous empirical verification. Reaction times to yes/no questions have been gathered from 28 subjects. Each subject participated in eight replications, viewing three kinds of graphs (bar, line and tables), each with and without color and grid lines, answering three types of questions (point reading, comparisons, and trends) with two levels of difficulty. The largest predictive component is the number of fixations, explaining 31 percent of the variation by itself. Overall, UCIE explains about 37 of the variation in reaction times. Graphics reduce cognitive overhead and enable people to perform certain tasks that would be more difficult, if not impossible, when the knowledge contained in the graphic was structured in a different format. The second study assesses decision making performance using a simulated business task with three levels of task complexity and two levels of quality of a graphic decision aid. The results suggest that the quality of the graphic decision aid influences performance only when the task is very complex. The explanatory power of UCIE can be exploited in several practical applications. The graphical perception and cognition "core" of UCIE can be a prototype for the analysis of more complex displays such as those for computer assisted software engineering tools, nuclear control rooms and cockpit design.},

We investigated whether this would apply using large print sizes more readily available in clinical situations (e.g. 2 degrees, 1.4 logMAR), for subjects with macular degeneration. We assessed rauding rates–reading for understanding. A combination of near word visual acuity and large print reading rate (without LVDs) provided the best prediction of oral rauding rates (with LVDs). However, near word visual acuity alone was almost as good. Similarly, silent rauding rate was predicted best by near word visual acuity alone. We give near visual acuity limits as a clinical guide to expected oral and silent reading performance with LVDs for patients with macular degeneration.},

METHODS: Seventy-eight subjects (aged 21 to 68 years) completed five measurements each of high- and low-contrast visual acuity, near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson chart). RESULTS: Except for correlations between high- and low-contrast visual acuity (r = 0.78), intercorrelations between tests were low to moderate (r {\textless} 0.5). For each measure, variability for the group was about one line on the chart (one triplet for the Pelli-Robson chart) and the minimum variability for an individual subject was about one third of this. On average, 1 to 2 lines can be expected to be lost over the normal lifespan on each test. Variability in responses did not increase significantly with age for any test. CONCLUSIONS: The criterion for judging change on commonly used clinical vision tests is about one line for subjects over a wide age range.},

There were significant differences between each of the groups tested. The ARM group showed greatly prolonged reaction time compared to the elderly normal subjects, whereas the preARM group had results between these two groups. The results indicate that functional changes are present before ARM can be diagnosed by conventional means; the consequences of these changes for the elderly motorist are discussed.},

This paper discusses several different procedures for assigning artifacts to sources and compares these procedures on the basis of their accuracy and the types of identification errors they make. Special attention is paid to discriminant analysis, which appears to be the best procedure for identifying sources of chert artifacts.},

  Abstract                 = {Partition entropy is the numerical metric of uncertainty within a partition of a finite set, while conditional entropy measures the degree of difficulty in predicting a decision partition when a condition partition is provided. Since two direct methods exist for defining conditional entropy based on its partition entropy, the inequality postulates of monotonicity, which conditional entropy satisfies, are actually additional constraints on its entropy. Thus, in this paper partition entropy is defined as a function of probability distribution, satisfying all the inequalities of not only partition entropy itself but also its conditional counterpart. These inequality postulates formalize the intuitive understandings of uncertainty contained in partitions of finite sets. We study the relationships between these inequalities, and reduce the redundancies among them. According to two different definitions of conditional entropy from its partition entropy, the convenient and unified checking conditions for any partition entropy are presented, respectively. These properties generalize and illuminate the common nature of all partition entropies.},

Experiment 1 manipulated the location of the negation in sentences that were followed by a probe recognition task. Subjects were slower to indicate that a probe had been in the sentence when the probe corresponded to a negated noun. Experiment 2 replicated these results with a probe naming task. Experiment 3 replicated the result that reading the phrase no bread inhibits responses to bread in the probe task but found no evidence of inhibition of the response to an associate probe, such as butter. The results of these three studies suggest that negation affects the discourse focus of a noun phrase, and hence the activation level of its representation.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model that explains how the working-memory capacity of a comprehender can constrain syntactic parsing and thereby affect the processing of syntactic ambiguities. The model's predictions are examined in four experiments that measure the reading times for two constructions that contain a temporary syntactic ambiguity. An example of the syntactic ambiguity is The soldiers warned about the dangers . . . ; the verb warned may either be the main verb, in which case soldiers is the agent; or the verb warned may introduce a relative clause, in which case soldiers is the patient of warned rather than the agent, as in The soldiers warned about the dangers conducted the midnight raid. The model proposes that both alternative interpretations of warned are initially activated. However, the duration for which both interpretations are maintained depends, in part, on the reader's working-memory capacity, which can be assessed by the Reading Span task (Daneman \& Carpenter, 1980). The word-by-word reading times indicate that all subjects do additional processing after encountering an ambiguity, suggesting that they generate both representations. Furthermore, readers with larger working-memory capacities maintain both representations for some period of time (several words), whereas readers with smaller working-memory capacities revert to maintaining only the more likely representation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new notion of partition-determined functions is introduced, and several basic inequalities are developed for the entropy of such functions of independent random variables, as well as for cardinalities of compound sets obtained using these functions. Here a compound set means a set obtained by varying each argument of a function of several variables over a set associated with that argument, where all the sets are subsets of an appropriate algebraic structure so that the function is well defined. On the one hand, the entropy inequalities developed for partition-determined functions imply entropic analogues of general inequalities of Pl"unnecke-Ruzsa type. On the other hand, the cardinality inequalities developed for compound sets imply several inequalities for sumsets, including for instance a generalization of inequalities proved by Gyarmati, Matolcsi and Ruzsa (2010). We also provide partial progress towards a conjecture of Ruzsa (2007) for sumsets in nonabelian groups. All proofs are elementary and rely on properly developing certain information-theoretic inequalities.},

Finding and integrating relevant data to assist in these analyses is crucial, but is difficult owing to ambiguous terminology and the lack of sufficient information about datasets. Ontologies provide a formal mechanism for defining terms and their relationships, and can improve the location, interpretation and integration of data based on its inherent meaning. Ontologies have assisted other disciplines (e.g. molecular biology) in unifying and enriching descriptions of data, and ecology can benefit from similar approaches. We review ontology efforts in ecology, and describe how these can benefit research by enhancing the location and interpretation of relevant data for confronting crucial ecological questions.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Little is known about the effect of font on low-vision reading. In this study, the authors measured the influence of font in reading with normal and low vision. METHODS: Reading acuity, maximum reading speed, and critical print size (the smallest print that can be read with maximum speed) were measured in 50 normal subjects and 42 subjects with low vision. Data were collected using versions of the MNREAD Acuity Chart printed with the Times (proportionally spaced) and Courier (fixed-width) fonts. RESULTS: Reading acuity scores obtained with Courier were better than those obtained with Times for both normal (mean difference, 0.05 logMAR, P {\textless} 0.001) and subjects with low vision (0.09 logMAR, P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, critical print sizes measured with Courier were smaller than those measured with Times (mean difference, 0.06 logMAR for normal subjects and subjects with low vision, P {\textless} 0.002). Maximum reading speeds for normal subjects were 5\% faster with Times than with Courier (P {\textless} 0.001), but for subjects with low vision, maximum reading speeds were 10\% slower with Times than with Courier (P {\textless} 0.05). For print smaller than the critical print size, the reading speeds of normal subjects and subjects with low vision were substantially slower (by as much as 50\%) for Times than for Courier. CONCLUSIONS: There are small, but significant, advantages of Courier over Times in reading acuity, critical print size, and reading speed for subjects with low vision. For normal subjects, the differences are slighter, with an advantage in reading speed for Times. However, for print sizes close to the acuity limit, choice of font could make a significant difference in both normal and low-vision reading performance.},

In either case, the expected outcome is to structure the originally less structured information prepared by taxonomists. In current research, domain experts and existing literature seem to play a crucial role in defining the target structure, either the templates for information extraction tasks, or the XML schema for the markup tasks},

We used a measure of eye movement characteristics in the form of a saccadic frequency score (SFS). Twelve subjects with macular disease were tested before and after an intense 6-week inpatient vision rehabilitation program. The mean age was 70.9 years (63 to 77 years). Mean visual acuity was 10/100 (10/40 to 10/200). Mean reading rates at entry and discharge were 8.5 words/min and 20.9 words/min, respectively (p = 0.02). SFS improved from 2.709 to 2.022 (p = 0.07). Reading errors improved from 5.60 to 4.00 (p = 0.03). Reading rates and SFS's were highly inversely correlated both pre- and post-treatment (Pearson r = -0.892 and -0.896, respectively). SFS and the number of reading errors were highly correlated with both pre- and post-treatment as well (Pearson r = 0.782 and 0.601, respectively). Interestingly the data appeared to cluster into two groups, one showing improvement and the other showing none. Cluster analysis revealed a strong association among reading rate, saccade scores, and reading errors. Membership in the two clusters is consistent pre- and post-rehabilitation in all but one case. Clustering is most evident for reading rate and reading errors and less so for saccade scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between reading rate and saccadic frequency in patients with macular degeneration was studied to determine if this simple measure of eye movements would be helpful in explaining the reduction in reading rates. Nineteen subjects and five controls were tested for visual acuity, reading rate, and saccadic frequency for intended stationary, simple left-to-right, and sequencing step tasks. Eye movements were recorded using an electro-oculography technique. Absolute eye position was not known. The results demonstrated that, using a 2 degree threshold for a stationary target, patients refixated a mean of 42.7 times per min, and controls refixated 0.00 times per min. For a two-letter left-to-right task, patients averaged 3.57 times more saccades than an ideal response, and controls had 1.14 times more saccades than ideal (P less than 0.01). For a five-letter left-to-right sequencing task, patients refixated a mean of 2.10 times more than ideal, and controls refixated 1.15 times more than ideal (P less than 0.05). Regression analysis demonstrated that sequencing task scores of saccadic frequency and visual acuity were the best predictors of reading rate (r2 = 0.705). These results indicate that higher saccadic frequencies are associated with lower reading rates and that there appears to be a relationship between the sequencing of visual information and reading rate.},

  Abstract                 = {The neural substrate underlying reading vs. listening comprehension of sentences was compared using fMRI. One way in which this issue was addressed was by comparing the patterns of activation particularly in cortical association areas that classically are implicated in language processing. The precise locations of the activation differed between the two modalities. In the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), the activation associated with listening was more anterior and inferior than the activation associated with reading, suggesting more semantic processing during listening comprehension. In the left posterior superior and middle temporal region (roughly, Wernicke's area), the activation for listening was closer to primary auditory cortex (more anterior and somewhat more lateral) than the activation for reading. In several regions, the activation was much more left lateralized for reading than for listening. In addition to differences in the location of the activation, there were also differences in the total amount of activation in the two modalities in several regions. A second way in which the modality comparison was addressed was by examining how the neural systems responded to comprehension workload in the two modalities by systematically varying the structural complexity of the sentences to be processed. Here, the distribution of the workload increase associated with the processing of additional structural complexity was very similar across the two input modalities. The results suggest a number of subtle differences in the cognitive processing underlying listening vs. reading comprehension. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Ontologies are knowledge structures to explicate the contents, essential properties, and relationships between terms in a knowledge source. Many sources are now accessible with associated ontologies. Most prior work on use of ontologies relies on the construction of a single global ontology covering all sources. Such an approach is not scalable and maintainable especially when the sources change frequently. We propose a scalable and easily maintainable approach based on the interoperation of on tologies. To handle user queries crossing the boundaries of the underlying information systems, the interoperation between the ontologies should be precisely defined. Our approach is to use rules that cross the semantic gap by creating an articulation or linkage between the systems. The rules are generated using a semi-automatic articulation tool with the help of a domain expert. To make the ontologies amenable for automatic composition based on the accumulated knowledge rules, we represent them using a graph-oriented model extended with a small algebraic operator set. ONION, a user-friendly toolkit, aids the experts in bridging the semantic gap in real-life settings. Our framework provides a sound foundation to simplify the work of domain experts, enables integration with public semantic dictionaries, like Wordnet, and will derive ODMG-compliant mediators automatically.}

Given that documented history, the object attains an authority that allows scholars to appreciate its importance with respect to other works, whereas, in the absence of such history, the object may be treated with some skepticism. Our IT landscape is evolving as illustrated by applications that are open, composed dynamically, and that discover results and services on the fly. Against this challenging background, it is crucial for users to be able to have confidence in the results produced by such applications. If the provenance of data produced by computer systems could be determined as it can for some works of art, then users, in their daily applications, would be able to interpret and judge the quality of data better. We introduce a provenance lifecycle and advocate an open approach based on two key principles to support a notion of provenance in computer systems: documentation of execution and user-tailored provenance queries.},

By defining only six terms as mandatory, it seeks to lighten the burden for providing or using multimedia useful for biodiversity science. At the same time it offers rich optional metadata terms that can help curators of multimedia collections provide authoritative media that document species occurrence, ecosystems, identification tools, ontologies, and many other kinds of biodiversity documents or data. About half of the vocabulary is re-used from other relevant controlled vocabularies that are often already in use for multimedia metadata, thereby reducing the mapping burden on existing repositories. A central design goal is to allow consuming applications to have a high likelihood of discovering suitable resources, reducing the human examination effort that might be required to decide if the resource is fit for the purpose of the application.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract People who classify and identify things based on their observable or deducible properties (called “characters” by biologists) can benefit from databases and keys that assist them in naming a specimen. This paper discusses our approach to generating an identification tool based on the field guide concept. Our software accepts character lists either expressed as XML (which biologists rarely provide knowingly—although most databases can now export in XML) or via ODBC connections to the data author’s relational database. The software then produces an Electronic Field Guide (EFG) implemented as a collection of Java servlets. The resulting guide answers queries made locally to a backend, or to Internet data sources via http, and returns XML. If, however, the query client requires HTML (e.g., if the EFG is responding to a human-centric browser interface that we or the remote application provides), or if some specialized XML is required, then the EFG forwards the XML to a servlet that applies an XSLT transformation to provide the look and feel that the client application requires. We compare our approach to the architecture of other taxon identification tools. Finally, we discuss how we combine this service with other biodiversity data services on the web to make integrated applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The relation between parafoveal letter and space information in eye movement guidance during reading was investigated in 2 experiments. Contingent upon the reader's fixation, the type of parafoveal information available to the right of fixation was varied by (a) space information only, (b) space information with letter information added at some delay, or (c) letter and space information simultaneously. In addition, the onset of the relevant parafoveal information was delayed between 0 and 250 ms into the fixation. The time course of processing the 2 types of information (letters or spaces) differed, as did the nature of their impact on the eye movement record. Although both letter and space information influenced saccade length and initial landing positions within words, only letter information had an effect on fixation duration. In addition, fixation duration was affected only by information entering within the first 50 ms of the fixation, whereas saccade length was affected by information arriving at any time during the fixation. The results are consistent with a model of eye movement control in which 2 independent processes are operating in tandem to determine when and where to move the eyes during reading.},

  Abstract                 = {In the paper some problems connected with a process of knowledge discovery are considered. These problems are reduced to the set cover problem. It is known that under a plausible assumption on the class N P the greedy algorithm is close to best approximate polynomial algorithms for the set cover problem solving. Unfortunately, the performance ratio of this algorithm grows almost as natural logarithm on the cardinality of covered set. Instead of usual greedy algorithm we consider greedy algorithm with threshold. This algorithm constructs a partial cover, which covers at least a fixed part (for example, 90\%) of the set. We prove that the cardinality of constructed partial cover is bounded from above by a linear function on the minimal cardinality of exact cover Cmin. In the case of 90\% -cover, for example, in the capacity of such function we can take the function 2.31,[middle dot],Cmin+1. This bound is independent of the cardinality of covered set. Notice that the concept of partial cover in context of knowledge discovery problems is very close to the concept of approximate reduct.},

  Abstract                 = {Word recognition performance varies systematically as a function of where the eyes fixate in the word. Performance is maximal with the eye slightly left of the center of the word and decreases drastically to both sides of this optimal viewing position. While manipulations of lexical factors have only marginal effects on this phenomenon, previous studies have pointed to a relation between the viewing position effect (VPE) and letter legibility: When letter legibility drops, the VPE becomes more exaggerated. To further investigate this phenomenon, we improved letter legibility by magnifying letter size in a way that was proportional to the distance from fixation (e.g., TABLE). Contrary to what would be expected if the VPE were due to limits of acuity, improving the legibility of letters has only a restricted influence on performance. In particular, for long words, a strong VPE remains even when letter legibility is equalized across eccentricities. The failure to neutralize the VPE is interpreted in terms of perceptual learning: Since normally, because of acuity limitations, the only information available in parafoveal vision concerns low-resolution features of letters; even when magnification provides better information, readers are unable to make use of it.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the implications of a range of global-mean sea-level rise and socio-economic scenarios on: (1) changes in flooding by storm surges; and (2) potential losses of coastal wetlands through the 21st century. These scenarios are derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Four different storylines are analysed: the A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 ‘worlds’. The climate scenarios are derived from the HadCM3 climate model driven by the SRES emission scenarios. The SRES scenarios for global-mean sea-level rise range from 22 cm (B1 world) to 34 cm (A1FI world) by the 2080s, relative to 1990. All other climate factors, including storm characteristics, are assumed to remain constant in the long term. Population and GDP scenarios are downscaled from the SRES regional analyses supplemented with other relevant scenarios for each impact analysis. The flood model predicts that about 10 million people/year experienced coastal flooding due to surges in 1990. The incidence of flooding will change without sea-level rise, but these changes are strongly controlled by assumptions on protection. Assuming that defence standards improve with growth in GDP/capita (lagged by 30 years), flood incidence increases in all four cases to the 2020s due to the growing exposed population. Then to the 2080s, the incidence of flooding declined significantly top5 million people/ year},

  Abstract                 = {Biomedical ontologies provide essential domain knowledge to drive data integration, information retrieval, data annotation, natural-language processing and decision support. BioPortal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org) is an open repository of biomedical ontologies that provides access via Web services and Web browsers to ontologies developed in OWL, RDF, OBO format and Protege frames. BioPortal functionality includes the ability to browse, search and visualize ontologies. The Web interface also facilitates community-based participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content by providing features to add notes to ontology terms, mappings between terms and ontology reviews based on criteria such as usability, domain coverage, quality of content, and documentation and support. BioPortal also enables integrated search of biomedical data resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ClinicalTrials.gov, and ArrayExpress, through the annotation and indexing of these resources with ontologies in BioPortal. Thus, BioPortal not only provides investigators, clinicians, and developers 'one-stop shopping' to programmatically access biomedical ontologies, but also provides support to integrate data from a variety of biomedical resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Contrast coding has been reported to differ between dyslexic and normal readers. Dyslexic readers require higher levels of contrast to detect sinewave gratings for certain spatiotemporal conditions, and dyslexic readers show faster visual search at low contrast. We investigated whether these differences in early contrast coding generalize to reading performance by measuring reading speed as a function of text contrast for dyslexic children and adults and for age-matched controls. Contrast affected reading performance of dyslexic and normal readers similarly. For both groups, reading speed was relatively constant between 100 and 2\% contrast, and decreased rapidly below 2\% contrast. This pattern of results held true for both children and adults, for text with and without sentence context, across a range of character sizes, and for reading aloud and reading silently. We conclude that earlier findings of group differences in contrast effects on grating detection or visual search tasks do not generalize to reading.},

  Abstract                 = {Four experiments were conducted to examine the extent to which readers construct elaborative inferences on-line during reading. In Experiment 1, gaze durations were measured while subjects read anaphors to target antecedents that referenced a particular category member either explicitly or implicitly. When the context strongly suggested a particular category member, gaze durations on an anaphor were the same following either an implicit or an explicit antecedent. When the context did not suggest any particular category member, gaze durations were significantly longer following an implicit antecedent. The results confirmed that, with sufficient context, readers will generate a simple elaborative inference on-line. These results were replicated in Experiment 2 in which the materials did not strongly signal the inference but a sentence designed to encourage subjects to infer was included. In Experiment 3, this "demand sentence" was not included, and readers did not appear to construct the targeted inference. The results of Experiment 4 confirmed that once generated, elaborative inferences are stored as part of the long-term-memory representation of a passage.},

  Abstract                 = {When a word is visually presented in a naming or comparison task in such a way that the eye is initially fixated at different locations within the word, a very strong effect of fixation location is found. The effect appears as a U-shaped curve. Naming time and total fixation time (gaze duration) have a minimum for an initial fixation location between the third and fifth letter of the word (for words that are 5-11 letters long). When initial fixation location deviates from this optimum position, times increase at the surprisingly fast rate of 20-30 ms per letter of deviation. By manipulating the internal lexical structure of the words, we show that at least part of the fixation location effect is caused by mechanisms related to ongoing lexical processing. This is demonstrated by the fact that the fixation location effect takes a different form when the most informative part of a word (as determined by dictionary counts) occurs at the beginning or the end of the word.},

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity informatics (BDI) information is both highly localized and highly distributed. The temporal and spatial contexts of data collection events are generally of primary importance in BDI studies, and most studies are focused around specific localities. At the same time, data are collected by many groups working independently, but often at the same sites, leading to a distribution of data. BDI data are also distributed over time, due to protracted longitudinal studies, and the continuously evolving meanings of taxonomic names. Ambient data integration provides new opportunities for collecting, sharing, and analyzing BDI data, and the nature of BDI data poses interesting challenges for applications of ADI. This paper surveys recent work on utilization of BDI data in the context of ADI. Topics covered include applying ADI to species identification, data security, annotation and provenance sharing, and coping with multiple competing classification ontologies. We conclude with a summary of requirements for applying ADI to biodiversity informatics.}

  Abstract                 = {Centuries of biological knowledge are contained in the massive body of scientific literature, written for human-readability but too big for any one person to consume. Large-scale mining of information from the literature is necessary if biology is to transform into a data-driven science. A computer can handle the volume but cannot make sense of the language. This paper reviews and discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to extract information from systematic literature. NLP algorithms have been used for decades, but require special development for application in the biological realm due to the special nature of the language. Many tools exist for biological information extraction (cellular processes, taxonomic names, and morphological characters), but none have been applied life wide and most still require testing and development. Progress has been made in developing algorithms for automated annotation of taxonomic text, identification of taxonomic names in text, and extraction of morphological character information from taxonomic descriptions. This manuscript will briefly discuss the key steps in applying information extraction tools to enhance biodiversity science.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to correlate functional recovery from aphasia after acute stroke with the temporal evolution of the anatomic, physiological, and functional changes as measured by MRI. METHODS: Blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast and echo-planar MRI were used to map language comprehension in 6 normal adults and in 2 adult patients during recovery from acute stroke presenting with aphasia. Perfusion, diffusion, sodium, and conventional anatomic MRI were used to follow physiological and structural changes. RESULTS: The normal activation pattern for language comprehension showed activation predominately in left-sided Wernicke's and Broca's areas, with laterality ratios of 0.8 and 0.3, respectively. Recovery of the patient confirmed as having a completed stroke affecting Broca's area occurred rapidly with a shift of activation to the homologous region in the right hemisphere within 3 days, with continued rightward lateralization over 6 months. In the second patient, in whom mapping was performed fortuitously before stroke, recovery of a Wernicke's aphasia showed a similar increasing rightward shift in activation recruitment over 9 months after the event. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of aphasia in adults can occur rapidly and is concomitant with an activation pattern that changes from left to a homologous right hemispheric pattern. Such recovery occurs even when the stroke evolves to completion. Such plasticity must be considered when evaluating stroke interventions based on behavioral and neurological measurements.},

Three patients with dense macular scotomas of at least 20 months duration and with no explicit low vision training were tested. SLO stimuli were produced by computer modulation of the scanned laser beam, and could be placed on known retinal loci by direct observation of the retina on a television monitor. Videotaped SLO images were analyzed to produce retinal maps that are corrected for shifts of stimulus position due to fixational eye movement, thus showing the true retinal locations of scotomas and fixation loci. Major findings were as follows: 1) each patient used a single, idiosyncratic retinal area, immediately adjacent to the scotoma to fixate, and did not attempt to use the nonfunctional foveola, 2) fixation stability with the eccentric fixation locus was as good as, or better than, that of ocularly normal subjects trying to fixate at comparable eccentricities, 3) fixation stability was not systematically related to clinical visual acuity, and 4) there is good agreement as to the shape and overall size of SLO and standard clinical tangent screen scotoma maps for these three patients.},

Using standard psychophysical techniques, we determined the retinal position of scotomas, the retinal areas used for fixating and inspecting acuity targets, and the retinal area used for reading simple, three-letter, nonsense syllables. We found that each patient used a single, idiosyncratic retinal area, immediately adjacent to the scotoma, for fixating, inspecting acuity targets, and scanning simple, nonsense-syllable text. This preferred retinal locus (PRL) was at different retinal eccentricities (relative to the foveola) for each patient and was not always as close as possible to the foveola. There appears to be no simple rule by which patients "select" a particular PRL. Plots of text placement on the retina revealed considerable differences in patients' abilities to execute an orderly text scan. Two patients read text more rapidly with a novel retinal area than with their PRL, suggesting that the PRL may not be optimal for text reading.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Ontologies are commonly used in biomedicine to organize concepts to describe domains such as anatomies, environments, experiment, taxonomies etc. NCBO BioPortal currently hosts about 180 different biomedical ontologies. These ontologies have been mainly expressed in either the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) format or the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OBO emerged from the Gene Ontology, and supports most of the biomedical ontology content. In comparison, OWL is a Semantic Web language, and is supported by the World Wide Web consortium together with integral query languages, rule languages and distributed infrastructure for information interchange. These features are highly desirable for the OBO content as well. A convenient method for leveraging these features for OBO ontologies is by transforming OBO ontologies to OWL. Results: We have developed a methodology for translating OBO ontologies to OWL using the organization of the Semantic Web itself to guide the work. The approach reveals that the constructs of OBO can be grouped together to form a similar layer cake. Thus we were able to decompose the problem into two parts. Most OBO constructs have easy and obvious equivalence to a construct in OWL. A small subset of OBO constructs requires deeper consideration. We have defined transformations for all constructs in an effort to foster a standard common mapping between OBO and OWL. Our mapping produces OWL-DL, a Description Logics based subset of OWL with desirable computational properties for efficiency and correctness. Our Java implementation of the mapping is part of the official Gene Ontology project source. Conclusions: Our transformation system provides a lossless roundtrip mapping for OBO ontologies, i.e. an OBO ontology may be translated to OWL and back without loss of knowledge. In addition, it provides a roadmap for bridging the gap between the two ontology languages in order to enable the use of ontology content in a language independent manner.},

These models can integrate different sources of information both horizontally (multi-modal and temporal fusion) and vertically (bottomup, topdown) by incorporating prior hierarchical knowledge expressed as an extensible ontology. Two implementations of this approach are presented. The first consists of a content-based image retrieval system that allows users to search image databases using an ontological query language. Queries are parsed using a probabilistic grammar and Bayesian networks to map high- level concepts onto low-level image descriptors, thereby bridging the semantic gap between users and the retrieval system. The second application extends the notion of onto- logical languages to video event detection. It is shown how effective high-level state and event recognition mechanisms can be learned from a set of annotated training sequences by incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints represented by an ontology.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological specimens in research collections provide the most important baseline information for systematic research. Traditionally, they are annotated by experts in written form, which remains directly associated with the specimens. These annotations, defined as data added at a later stage to the original data, provide an important quality control mechanism. They improve the value of herbarium specimens and are identification trails documenting the development of taxonomic concepts over time. With specimen data increasingly becoming accessible via the Internet, a general online annotation system that ensures that the traditional data sharing and documentation of specimen data is continued after the information is mobilised through digitisation, is currently missing. We lay out the prerequisites for such an annotation system including data standards, a data repository, system access, and user roles. We also introduce an exemplar solution developed in the DFG-funded AnnoSys project. AnnoSys is being implemented using the example of collection and observation data in the botanical domain as provided by the GBIF/BioCASe networks. It provides a user-friendly interface to allow researchers to produce and discover annotations. If a record has been annotated, both the annotation and the original record will be stored in a repository, linked via a persistent identifier, and will be accessible through the AnnoSys interfaces. Collection holders and scientists specifically interested in a subset of data will be informed about annotations in which they have expressed interest. We discuss AnnoSys in relation to the FilteredPush project, which pursues the same goal in facilitating and communicating online annotations, but which takes a different approach.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To report on the usefulness of the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS) questionnaire for assessing visual functioning, a population-based sample of elderly Americans. METHODS: The ADVS questionnaire was administered to a population-based sample of 2520 community-dwelling individuals 65 to 84 years of age in Salisbury, MD. Items and subscales were evaluated for internal consistency, item discrimination, and content validity. Published subscale groupings and item associations in our population were compared for coherence using correlation, factor, and cluster analyses. Whole-sample and race- and gender-specific analyses were conducted. External validity was explored by regressing ADVS scores on standard psychophysical vision measures. RESULTS: ADVS scores were skewed to high visual functioning levels; approximately 60\% of the population had function scores of 95 or better (of a possible 100). The overall, night driving, and near vision scales were internally consistent and had strong item-subscale associations; the day driving and glare subscales were not acceptable regarding these properties. The far vision subscale was acceptably scalable but only weakly differentiated from the other subscales. Overall, night driving, near vision, and far vision scores were all statistically and independently associated with multiple psychophysical vision measures. Findings were consistent across race and gender subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: As assessed by the ADVS, reported visual functioning is high in our representative older population. The overall scale and selected subscales effectively distinguish persons along a spectrum of ability. They correlate with measures of visual impairment in a reasonable way and thus hold promise for risk factor investigations. The published day driving and glare subscales should be examined for relevance and consistency before being applied in population-based settings. Methods specific to population-based settings should be investigated for their ability to better elicit additional visual function dimensions and early visual disability.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract I present a conceptualization that attempts to unify diverse representations of natural knowledge while providing a workable computational framework, based on current semantic web theory, for developing, communicating, and running integrated simulation models. The approach is based on a long-standing principle of scientific investigation: the separation of the ontological character of the object of study from the semantics of the observation context, the latter including location in space and time and other observation-related aspects. I will show how current Knowledge Representation theories coupled with the object-oriented paradigm allow an efficient integration through the abstract model of a domain, which relates to the idea of aspect in software engineering. This conceptualization allows us to factor out two fundamental causes of complexity and awkwardness in the representation of knowledge about natural system: (a) the distinction between data and models, both seen here as generic knowledge sources; (b) the multiplicity of states in data sources, handled through the hierarchical composition of independently defined domain objects, each accounting for all states in one well-known observational dimension. This simplification leaves modelers free to work with the bare conceptual bones of the problem, encapsulating complexities connected to data format, and scale. I will then describe the design of a software system that implements the approach, referring to explicit ontologies to unambiguously characterize the semantics of the objects of study, and allowing the independent definition of a global observation context that can be redefined as required. I will briefly discuss applications to multi-scale, multi-paradigm modeling, intelligent database design, and web-based collaboration.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of the present study was to compare the oculomotor behavior of readers scanning meaningful and meaningless materials. Four conditions were used–a normal-text-reading control condition, and three experimental conditions in which the amount of linguistic processing was reduced, either by presenting the subjects with repeated letter strings or by asking the subjects to search for a target letter in texts or letter strings. The results show that global eye-movement characteristics (such as saccade size and fixation duration), as well as local characteristics (such as word-skipping rate, landing site, refixation probability, and refixation position), are very similar in the four conditions. The finding that the eyes are capable of generating an autonomous oculomotor scanning strategy in the absence of any linguistic information to process argues in favor of the idea that such predetermined oculomotor strategies might be an important determinant of eye movements in reading.},

  Abstract                 = {During isolated-word reading, within-word eye-movement tactics (i.e., whether the eye makes one or more fixations on the word) depend strongly on the eye's first fixation position in the word; there exists an optimal landing position where the probability of having to refixate the word is much smaller than when the eye first fixates other parts of the word. The present experiment was designed to test whether the optimal landing position effect still exists during text reading, and to compare the nature and strength of the effect with the effect found for isolated words. The results confirmed the existence of an optimal landing position in both reading conditions, but the effect for words in texts was weaker than it was for isolated words, probably because of the presence of factors such as reading rhythm and linguistic context. However, the effect still existed in text reading; within-word tactics during text reading are dependent on the eye's initial landing position in words. Moreover, individual fixation durations were dependent on within-word tactics. Thus, the initial landing position in words must be taken into account if one wishes to understand eye-movement behavior during text reading. Further results concerned the effects of word length and word frequency in both reading conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with formally defined meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. This document serves as an introduction to OWL 2 and the various other OWL 2 documents. It describes the syntaxes for OWL 2, the different kinds of semantics, the available profiles (sub-languages), and the relationship between OWL 1 and OWL 2.}

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity data derive from myriad sources stored in various formats on many distinct hardware and software platforms. An essential step towards understanding global patterns of biodiversity is to provide a standardized view of these heterogeneous data sources to improve interoperability. Fundamental to this advance are definitions of common terms. This paper describes the evolution and development of Darwin Core, a data standard for publishing and integrating biodiversity information. We focus on the categories of terms that define the standard, differences between simple and relational Darwin Core, how the standard has been implemented, and the community processes that are essential for maintenance and growth of the standard. We present case-study extensions of the Darwin Core into new research communities, including metagenomics and genetic resources. We close by showing how Darwin Core records are integrated to create new knowledge products documenting species distributions and changes due to environmental perturbations.},
